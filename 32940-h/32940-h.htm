<p class="center pt2 sc">1. Topography.</p>

<p>England extends from the mouth of the Tweed in 55° 46&prime; N. to
Lizard Point in 49° 57&prime; 30&Prime; N., in a roughly triangular form. The
base of the triangle runs from the South Foreland to Land&rsquo;s End
W. by S., a distance of 316 m. in a straight line, but 545 m.
following the larger curves of the coast. The east coast runs
N.N.W. from the South Foreland to Berwick, a distance of 348 m.,
or, following the coast, 640 m. The west coast runs N.N.E. from
Land&rsquo;s End to the head of Solway Firth, a distance of 354 m.,
or following the much-indented coast, 1225 m. The total length
of the coast-line may be put down as 2350 m.,<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> out of which
515 m. belong to the western principality of Wales.<a name="fa3a" id="fa3a" href="#ft3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a> The most
easterly point is at Lowestoft, 1° 46&prime; E., the most westerly is
Land&rsquo;s End, in 5° 43&prime; W. The coasts are nowhere washed directly
by the ocean, except in the extreme south-west; the south coast
faces the English Channel, which is bounded on the southern side
by the coast of France, the two shores converging from 100 m.
apart at the Lizard to 21 at Dover. The east coast faces the
shallow North Sea, which widens from the point where it joins the
Channel to 375 m. off the mouth of the Tweed, the opposite shores
being occupied in succession by France, Belgium, Holland,
Germany and Denmark. The west coast faces the Irish Sea, with
a width varying from 45 to 130 m.</p>

<p>The area of England and Wales is 37,327,479 acres or 58,324
sq. m. (England, 50,851 sq. m.), and the population on this area
in 1901 was 32,527,843 (England, 30,807,232). The principal
territorial divisions of England, as of Wales, Scotland and
Ireland, are the counties, of which England comprises 40.
Their boundaries are not as a rule determined by the physical
features of the land; but localities are habitually defined by the
use of their names. A list of the English counties (excluding
Wales) is given in the table above.<a name="fa4a" id="fa4a" href="#ft4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p><i>Hills.</i>&mdash;As an introduction to the discussion of the natural
regions into which England is divided (Section II.), and for the
sake of comparison of altitudes, size of rivers and similar details,
the salient geographical features may be briefly summarized.
The short land-frontier of England with Scotland (its length is
only 100 m.) is in great measure a physical boundary, as considerable
lengths of it are formed on the east side by the river
Tweed, and on the west by Kershope Burn, Liddel Water, and the
river Sark; while for the rest it follows pretty closely the summit
of the Cheviot Hills, whose highest point is the Cheviot (2676 ft.).
A narrow but well-marked pass or depression, known as the Tyne
Gap, is taken to separate the Cheviot system from the Pennine
Chain, which is properly to be described as a wide tract of hill-country,
extending through two degrees of latitude, on an axis
from N. by W. to S. by E. The highest point is Cross Fell
(2930 ft.). On the north-west side of the Pennine system,
marked off from it by the upper valleys of the rivers Eden and
Lune, lies the circular hill-tract whose narrow valleys, radiating
from its centre somewhat like wheel-spokes, contain the beautiful
lakes which give it the celebrated name of the Lake District.
In this tract is found the highest land in England, Scafell Pike
reaching 3210 ft. East of the Pennines, isolated on three sides by
lowlands and on the fourth side by the North Sea, lie the highmoors
of the North Riding of Yorkshire, with the Cleveland Hills, and,
to the south, the Yorkshire Wolds of the East Riding. Neither of
these systems has any great elevation; the moors, towards their
north-western edge, reaching an extreme of 1489 ft. in Urra Moor.
The tableland called the Peak of Derbyshire, in the south of the
Pennine system, is 2088 ft. in extreme height, but south of this
system an elevation of 2000 ft. is not found anywhere in England
save at a few points on the south Welsh border and in Dartmoor,
in the south-west. Wales, on the other hand, projecting into the
western sea between Liverpool Bay and the estuary of the Dee on
the north, and the Bristol Channel on the south, is practically
all mountainous, and has in Snowdon, in the north-west, a higher
summit than any in England&mdash;3560 ft. But the midlands, the
west, and the south of England, in spite of an absence of great
elevation, contain no plains of such extent as might make for
monotony. The land, generally undulating, is further diversified
with hills arranged in groups or ranges, a common characteristic
of which is a bold face on the one hand and a long gentle slope,
with narrow valleys deeply penetrating, on the other. Southward
from the Pennines there may be mentioned, in the midlands,
the small elevated tract of Charnwood Forest (Bardon Hill, 912
ft.) in Leicestershire, and Cannock Chase (775 ft.) and the Clent
Hills (928 ft.), respectively north and south of the great manufacturing
district of Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Of the
western counties, the southern half of Shropshire, Herefordshire
and Monmouthshire are generally hilly. Among the Shropshire
Hills may be mentioned the isolated Wrekin (1335 ft.), Long
Mynd (1674 ft.) and the Clee Hills (Brown Clee, 1805 ft.). The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>409</span>
long ridge of the Black Mountain reaches an extreme height of
2310 ft. on the Welsh border of Herefordshire. The Malvern Hills
on the other side of the county, which, owing to their almost
isolated position among lowlands, appear a far more prominent
feature, reach only 1395 ft. In western Monmouthshire, again
belonging to the south Welsh system, there are such heights as
Sugar Loaf (1955 ft.) and Coity (1905 ft.).</p>

<p class="pt2">In the south midlands of England there are two main ranges of
hills, with axes roughly parallel. The western range is the
Cotteswold Hills of Gloucestershire and the counties adjacent on
the east running S.W. and N.E. Its highest point is Cleeve Cloud
(1134 ft.). The uplands of Northamptonshire continue this
range north-eastward, decreasing in elevation. The eastern range,
beginning in Wiltshire, runs E.N.E. as the White Horse Hills
(856 ft. at the highest point), and after the interruption caused by
the gap or narrow valley by which the river Thames penetrates
the hills near Goring, continues N.E. as the Chiltern Hills (850
ft.). The East Anglian ridge continues the line E.N.E., gradually
decreasing in altitude. In the south-east of England, the North
and South Downs are both well-defined ranges, but are characterized
by a number of breaches through which rivers penetrate, on
the one hand to the Thames or the North Sea and on the other to
the English Channel. Leith Hill in the North Downs reaches
965 ft., and Butser Hill in the South Downs 889 ft.; Blackdown
and Hindhead, two almost isolated masses of high ground lying
between the two ranges of the Downs towards their western
extremity, are respectively 918 and 895 ft. in height. In the north
of Hampshire along its boundary with Surrey and Berkshire, in
the southern half of Wiltshire (where rises the upland of Salisbury
Plain), in Dorsetshire, and the south of Somersetshire, the hills
may be said to run in a series of connected groups. They cannot
be defined as a single range, nor are they named, as a rule,
according to the groups into which they fall, but the general title
of the Western Downs is applied to them. One point only in all
these groups exceeds 1000 ft. in altitude, namely, Inkpen
Beacon (1011 ft.) in the extreme south-west of Berkshire, but
heights above 900 ft. are not infrequent. In the northern part of
Somersetshire, two ranges, short but well defined, lie respectively
east and west of a low plain which slopes to the Bristol Channel.
These are the Mendips (Black Down, 1068 ft.) and the Quantocks
(Will&rsquo;s Neck, 1261 ft.). The Blackdown Hills, in south-western
Somersetshire and eastern Devonshire, reach 1035 ft. in Staple
Hill in the first-named county. In western Somersetshire and
north Devonshire the elevated mass of Exmoor reaches 1707 ft.
in Dunkery Beacon; and in south Devonshire the highest land in
southern England is found in the similar mass of Dartmoor (High
Willhays, 2039 ft.). The westward prolongation of the great
south-western promontory of England, occupied by the county of
Cornwall, continues as a rugged ridge broken by a succession of
depressions, and exceeds a height of 800 ft., nearly as far as the
point where it falls to the ocean in the cliffs of Land&rsquo;s End.</p>

<p><i>Lowlands.</i>&mdash;The localities of the more extensive lowlands of
England may now be indicated in their relation to the principal
hill-systems, and in this connexion the names of some of the
more important rivers will occur. In the extreme north-west
is the so-called Solway Plain, of no great extent, but clearly
defined between the northern foothills of the Lake District and
the shore of Solway Firth. In Lancashire a flat coastal strip
occurs between the western front of the Pennine Chain and the
Irish Sea, and, widening southward, extends into Cheshire and
comprises the lower valleys of the Mersey and the Dee. In the
preceding review of the English hill-systems it may have been
observed that eastern England hardly enters into consideration.
The reason now becomes clear. From Yorkshire to the flat
indented sea-coast north of the Thames estuary, east of the
Pennines and the slight hills indicated as the Northampton
uplands, and in part demarcated southward by the East Anglian
ridge in Huntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire and Suffolk, the land,
although divided between a succession of river-systems, varies
so little in level as to be capable of consideration as a single
plain. Its character, however, varies in different parts. The
Fens, the flat open levels in the lower basins of the Witham,
Welland, Nene and Great Ouse, only kept from their former
marshy conditions by an extensive system of artificial drainage,
and the similar levels round the head of the Humber estuary,
differ completely in appearance from the higher and firmer
parts of the plain. The coast-land north of the mouth of the
Thames is a low plain; and on the south coast somewhat
similar tracts are found in Romney Marsh, and about the shallow
inlets (Portsmouth Harbour and others) which open from
Spithead. The vales of Kent and Sussex are rich undulating
lowlands within the area of the Weald, separated by the Forest
Ridges, and enclosed by the North and South Downs. In the
south-west there is a fairly extensive lowland in south Devonshire
watered by the Exe in its lower course. But the most
remarkable plain is that in Somersetshire, enclosed by the
Mendips, the Western Downs, Blackdown Hills and the Quantocks
and entered by the Parrett and other streams. The midlands,
owing to the comparatively slight elevation of the land,
are capable of geographical consideration as a plain. But it is
not a plain in the sense of that of East Anglia. There is no
quite level tract of great extent, excepting perhaps the fertile
and beautiful district watered by the lower Severn and its
tributary the Upper or Warwickshire Avon, overlooked by the
Cotteswolds on the one hand and the Malvern and other hills
on the other.</p>

<p><i>Coast.</i>&mdash;The coast-line of England is deeply indented by a
succession of large inlets, particularly on the east and west.
Thus, from north to south there are, on the east coast, the mouths
of the Tyne and the Tees, the Humber estuary, the Wash
(which receives the waters of the Witham, Welland, Nene and
Great Ouse), the Orwell-Stour, Blackwater and Thames-Medway
estuaries. On the west there are Solway Firth, Morecambe
Bay, the estuaries of the Mersey and Dee, Cardigan
Bay of the Welsh coast, and the Bristol Channel and Severn
estuary. In this way the land is so deeply penetrated by the
water that no part is more than 75 m. from the sea. Thus
Buckingham appears to be the most inland town in England,
being 75 m. from the estuaries of the Severn, Thames and Wash;
Coleshill, near Birmingham, is also almost exactly 75 m. from
the Mersey, Severn and Wash.</p>

<p>The east and south coasts show considerable stretches of
uniform uninflected coast-line, and except for the Farne Islands
and Holy Island in the extreme north, the flat islands formed
by ramifications of the estuaries on the Essex and north Kent
coasts, and the Isle of Wight in the south, they are without
islands. The west coast, on the other hand, including both
shores of the great south-western promontory, is minutely
fretted into capes and bays, headlands and inlets of every size,
and an island-group lies off each of the more prominent headlands
from Land&rsquo;s End northward. The formation of the coast
varies from low, shifting banks of shingle or sand to majestic
cliffs, and its character in different localities has been foreshadowed
in the previous consideration of the hill-systems and
lowlands. Thus in the north-east the coast is generally of no
great elevation, but the foothills of the Cheviot and Pennine
systems approach it closely. On the Yorkshire coast the
Cleveland Hills and the high moors are cut off on the seaward
side in magnificent cliffs, which reach the greatest elevation of
sea-cliffs on the English coast (666 ft.). The Yorkshire Wolds
similarly terminate seaward in the noble promontory of Flamborough
Head. From this point as far south as the North
Foreland of Kent the coast, like the land, is almost wholly low,
though there are slight cliffs at some points, as along the coasts
of Norfolk and Suffolk, on which the sea constantly encroaches.
On the south coast a succession of cliffs and low shores may be
correlated with the main physical features of the land. Thus
in succession there are the famous white cliffs about Dover,
terminating the North Downs, the low coast of Romney Marsh,
projecting seaward in Dungeness, the cliffs above Hastings,
terminating an offshoot of the Forest Ridges, the low shore
between Hastings and Eastbourne, to which succeeds the lofty
Beachy Head, terminating the South Downs. A flat coast
follows as far as Selsey Bill and Spithead, but the south coast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>410</span>
of the Isle of Wight shows a succession of splendid cliffs. The
shallow inlet of Poole Bay is followed by the eminence of St
Alban&rsquo;s Head, and thereafter, right round the south-western
promontory of England, the cliff-bound coast, with its bays
and inlets closely beset with hills, predominates over the low
shore-line, exhibits a remarkable series of different forms, and
provides the finest scenery of its kind in England. The shores
of the Severn estuary are low, but the Welsh coast, sharing the
general character of the land, is more or less elevated throughout,
though none of the higher mountain-masses directly approaches
the sea. Low shores correspond to the plains of Cheshire,
Lancashire and the Solway, while the intervening coast is of
no great elevation, as only the foothills of the Lake District
approach it with a gradual slope.</p>

<p>A great extent of the English coast is constantly undergoing
visible alteration, the sea in some instances receding from the
land, and in others gaining upon it. The whole of Romney
Marsh, in Kent and Sussex, formerly constituted an arm of the
sea, where vessels rode in deep water, carrying produce to ports
no longer in existence. Lydd and Romney, though maritime
still in name, retaining some of the ancient privileges of the
Cinque Ports, have become, through changes in the coast-line,
small inland towns; and the same has been the fate of Rye,
Winchelsea, and other places in that district. Again, the Isle
of Thanet, in the north-eastern corner of Kent, has practically
ceased to be an island. The wide estuary of the sea separating
it from the mainland, through which ships sailed from the
English Channel into the Thames, using it as the shortest route
from the south to London, has entirely disappeared, leaving
only a flat lowland traversed by branches of the river Stour to
mark its former existence. The sea is encroaching over a considerable
extent of coast-line on the North Sea as well as on the
English Channel. Ravenspur, once an important town of
Yorkshire, where Bolingbroke, afterwards Henry IV., landed
in 1399, is now submerged; and Dunwich and other ancient
ports in East Anglia have met with the same fate. The process
of destruction, slow in some places, is so rapid in others that
it can be traced even from month to month&mdash;the incessant
work of the waves washing away the soft strata at the base of
the cliffs and leaving the summits unsupported. Many cliffs
of the east coast, from the Humber to the mouth of the Thames,
are suffering from this destructive action, and instances also
occur on the south coast. A royal commission on Coast Erosion
was appointed to inquire into this question in 1906 (see <i>Report</i>,
1907 sqq.).</p>

<p>Except along the centre of the Irish Sea, at one point off the
Tweed and one between Devon and Normandy, the depth of
water between England and the nearest land nowhere exceeds
50 fathoms.</p>

<p><i>Rivers.</i>&mdash;The variations in length of the general slope of the
land towards successive natural divisions of the coast may be
illustrated by a comparative table of the mileage and drainage
areas of the principal English rivers. The mileage does not
take account of the lesser sinuosities of rivers.</p>

<p>With the exception of those in the Lake District (<i>q.v.</i>) the
lakes of England are few and insignificant. A number of small
meres occur in a defined area in Cheshire.</p>
<div class="author">(O. J. R. H.)</div>

<p class="center pt2 sc">II. Physical Geography</p>

<p>The object of this section is to give a physical description of
England and Wales according to natural regions, which usually
follow the geology of the country very closely; although the
relationship of configuration and geology is not so simple or so
clearly marked as in Scotland.</p>

<p>The land is highest in the west and north, where the rocks also
are oldest, most disturbed, and hardest, and the land surface
gradually sinks towards the east and south, where the rocks become
successively less disturbed, more recent, and softer. The study
of the scenery of England and Wales as a whole, or the study of
orographical and geological maps of the country, allows a broad
distinction to be drawn between the types of land-forms in the
west and in the east. This distinction is essential, and applies to
all the conditions of which geography takes account. The
contrasted districts are separated by an intermediate area, which
softens the transition between them, and may be described
separately.</p>

<p>The Western Division is composed entirely of Archaean and
Palaeozoic rocks, embracing the whole range from pre-Cambrian
up to Carboniferous. The outcrops of these rocks succeed each
other in order of age in roughly concentric belts, with the Archaean
mass of the island of Anglesey as a centre, but the arrangement in
detail is much disturbed and often very irregular. Contemporary
igneous outbursts are extremely common in some of the ancient
formations, and add, by their resistance to atmospheric erosion,
to the extreme ruggedness of the scenery. The hills and uplands
of ancient rocks do not form regular ranges, but rise like islands in
four distinct groups from a plain of New Red Sandstone (Permian
and Triassic), which separates them from each other and from the
newer rocks of the Eastern Division. Each of the uplands is a
centre for the dispersal of streams; but with only one prominent
exception (the Humber) these reach the sea without crossing
into the Eastern Division of the country.</p>

<p>The Eastern Division, lying to the east of the zone of New Red
Sandstone, may be defined on the west by a slightly curved line
drawn from the estuary of the Tees through Leicester and
Stratford-on-Avon to the estuary of the Severn, and thence
through Glastonbury to Sidmouth. It is built up of nearly
uniform sheets of Mesozoic rock, the various beds of the Jurassic
lying above the New Red Sandstone (Triassic), and dipping
south-eastward under the successive beds of the Cretaceous
system. In exactly the same way the whole of the south-east of
the island appears to have been covered uniformly with gently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>411</span>
dipping beds of Tertiary sands and clays, beneath which the
Cretaceous strata dipped. At some period subsequent to this
deposition there was a movement of elevation, which appears to
have thrown the whole mass of rocks into a fold along an anticlinal
axis running west and east, which was flanked to north and
south by synclinal hollows. In these hollows the Tertiary rocks
were protected from erosion, and remain to form the London and
the Hampshire Basins respectively, while on the anticlinal axis
the whole of the Tertiary and the upper Cretaceous strata have
been dissected away, and a complex and beautiful configuration
has been impressed on the district of the Weald. The general
character of the landscape in the Eastern Division is a succession
of steep escarpments formed by the edges of the outcropping beds
of harder rock, and long gentle slopes or plains on the dip-slopes,
or on the softer layers; clay and hard rock alternating throughout
the series.</p>

<p>The contrast between the lower grounds of the Western and
the Eastern Divisions is masked in many places by the general
covering of the surface with glacial drift, which is usually a stiff
clay composed on the whole of the detritus of the rocks upon
which it rests, though containing fragments of rocks which have
been transported from a considerable distance. This boulder
clay covers almost all the low ground north of the Thames Basin,
its southern margin fading away into washed sands and gravels.</p>

<p>The history of the origin of the land-forms of England, as far as
they have been deduced from geological studies, is exceedingly
complicated. The fact that every known geological formation
(except the Miocene) is represented, proves of itself how long the
history has been, and how multifarious the changes. It must
suffice to say that the separation of Ireland from England was a
comparatively recent episode, while the severance of the land-connexion
between England and the continent by the formation
of the Strait of Dover is still more recent and probably occurred
with the human period.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Natural Divisions.</i>&mdash;The four prominent groups of high land
rising from the plain of the Red Rocks are: (1) the <i>Lake District</i>,
bounded by the Solway Firth, Morecambe Bay and the
valleys of the Eden and the Lune; (2) the <i>Pennine
Region</i>, <span class="sidenote">The western division.</span> which stretches from the Scottish border to the
centre of England, running south; (3) <i>Wales</i>, occupying
the peninsula between the Mersey and the Bristol Channel, and
extending beyond the political boundaries of the principality to
include Shropshire and Hereford; and (4) the peninsula of <i>Cornwall
and Devon</i>. They are all similar in the great features of their
land-forms, which have been impressed upon them by the prolonged
action of atmospheric denudation rather than by the original order
and arrangement of the rocks; but each group has its own geological
character, which has imparted something of a distinctive individuality
to the scenery. Taken as a whole, the Western Division
depends for its prosperity on mineral products and manufactures
rather than on farming; and the staple of the farmers is live-stock
rather than agriculture. The people of the more rugged and remoter
groups of this division are by race survivors of the early Celtic stock,
which, being driven by successive invaders from the open and fertile
country of the Eastern Division, found refuges in the less inviting
but more easily defended lands of the west. Even where, as in the
Pennine region and the Lake District, the people have been completely
assimilated with the Teutonic stock, they retain a typical
character, marked by independence of opinion approaching stubbornness,
and by great determination and enterprise.</p>

<p><i>Lake District.</i>&mdash;The Lake District occupies the counties of Cumberland,
Westmorland and North Lancashire. It forms a roughly
circular highland area, the drainage lines of which radiate outward
from the centre in a series of narrow valleys, the upper parts of
which cut deeply into the mountains, and the lower widen into the
surrounding plain. Sheets of standing water are still numerous,
and formerly almost every valley contained a single long narrow
lake-basin; but some of these have been subdivided, drained or
filled up by natural processes. The existing lakes include Windermere
and Coniston, draining south; Wastwater, draining south-west,
Ennerdale water, Buttermere and Crummock water (the two latter,
originally one lake, are now divided by a lateral delta), draining
north-west; Derwent water and Bassenthwaite water (which were
probably originally one lake), and Thirlmere, draining north;
Ullswater and Haweswater, draining north-east. There are,
besides, numerous mountain tarns of small size, most of them in
hollows barred by the glacial drift which covers a great part of
the district. The central and most picturesque part of the district
is formed of great masses of volcanic ashes and tuffs, with intrusions
of basalts and granite, all of Ordovician (Lower Silurian)
age. Scafell and Scafell Pike (3162 and 3210 ft.), at the head
of Wastwater, and Helvellyn (3118), at the head of Ullswater, are
the loftiest amongst many summits the grandeur of whose outlines
is not to be estimated by their moderate height. Sedimentary rocks
of the same age form a belt to the north, and include Skiddaw
(3054 ft.); while to the south a belt of Silurian rocks, thickly
covered with boulder clay, forms the finely wooded valleys of
Coniston and Windermere. Round these central masses of early
Palaeozoic rocks there is a broken ring of Carboniferous Limestone,
and several patches of Coal Measures, while the New Red Sandstone
appears as a boundary belt outside the greater part of the
district. Where the Coal Measures reach the sea at Whitehaven,
there are coal-mines, and the hematite of the Carboniferous Limestones
has given rise to the active ironworks of Barrow-in-Furness,
now the largest town in the district. Except in the towns of the
outer border, the Lake District is very thinly peopled; and from the
economic point of view, the remarkable beauty of its scenery,
attracting numerous residents and tourists, is the most valuable
of its resources. The very heavy rainfall of the district, which is
the wettest in England, has led to the utilization of Thirlmere as
a reservoir for the water supply of Manchester, over 80 m. distant.</p>

<p><i>Pennine Region.</i>&mdash;The Pennine Region, the centre of which
forms the so-called Pennine Chain, occupies the country from the
Eden valley to the North Sea in the north, and from the lower
Tees, Yorkshire Ouse and Trent, nearly to the Irish Sea, in the
south. It includes the whole of Northumberland and Durham,
the West Riding of Yorkshire, most of Lancashire and Derbyshire,
the north of Staffordshire and the west of Nottinghamshire. The
region is entirely composed of Carboniferous rocks, the system which
transcends all others in the value of its economic minerals. The
coal and iron have made parts of the region the busiest manufacturing
districts, and the centres of densest population, in the country,
or even in the world. The whole region may be looked upon as
formed by an arch or anticline of Carboniferous strata, the axis of
which runs north and south; the centre has been worn away by
erosion, so that the Coal Measures have been removed, and the
underlying Millstone Grit and Carboniferous Limestone exposed
to the influences which form scenery. On both sides of the arch,
east and west, the Coal Measures remain intact, forming outcrops
which disappear towards the sea under the more recent strata of
Permian or Triassic age. The northern part of the western side of
the anticline is broken off by a great fault in the valley of the Eden,
and the scarp thus formed is rendered more abrupt by the presence
of a sheet of intrusive basalt. Seen from the valley, this straight
line of lofty heights, culminating in Crossfell, presents the nearest
approach in England to the appearance of a mountain range. In
the north the Pennine region is joined to the Southern Uplands of
Scotland by the Cheviot Hills, a mass of granite and Old Red Sandstone;
and the northern part is largely traversed by dykes of
contemporary volcanic or intrusive rock. The most striking of these
dykes is the Great Whin Sill, which crosses the country from a short
distance south of Durham almost to the source of the Tees, near
Crossfell. The elevated land is divided into three masses by depressions,
which furnish ready means of communication between east and
west. The South Tyne and Irthing valleys cut off the Cheviots on
the north from the Crossfell section, which is also marked off on the
south by the valleys of the Aire and Ribble from the Kinder Scout
or Peak section. The numerous streams of the region carry off
the rainfall down long valleys or dales to the east and the south,
and by shorter and steeper valleys to the west. The dales are
separated from each other by high uplands, which for the most
part are heathery moorland or, at best, hill pastures. The agriculture
of the region is confined to the bottoms of the dales, and is of small
importance. Crossfell and the neighbouring hills are formed
from masses of Carboniferous Limestone, which received its popular
name of Mountain Limestone from this fact. Farther south, such
summits as High Seat, Whernside, Bow Fell, Penyghent and many
others, all over 2000 ft. in height, are capped by portions of the grits
and sandstones, which rest upon the limestone. The belt of Millstone
Grit south of the Aire, lying between the great coal-fields of the
West Riding and Lancashire, has a lower elevation, and forms grassy
uplands and dales; but farther south, the finest scenery of the whole
region occurs in the limestones of Derbyshire, in which the range
terminates. The rugged beauty of the south-running valleys, and
especially of Dovedale, is enhanced by the rich woods which still
clothe the slopes. There are remarkable features underground as
well as on the surface, the caverns and subterranean streams of
Yorkshire and Derbyshire being amongst the deepest that have yet
been explored. Compared with the rugged and picturesque scenery
of the Lower Carboniferous rocks, that of the Coal Measures is, as a
rule, featureless and monotonous. The coal-fields on the eastern
side, from the Tyne nearly to the Trent, are sharply marked off on
the east by the outcrop of Permian dolomite or Magnesian limestone,
which forms a low terrace dipping towards the east under more recent
rocks, and in many places giving rise to an escarpment facing westward
towards the gentle slope of the Pennine dales. To the west and
south the Coal Measures dip gently under the New Red Sandstone,
to reappear at several points through the Triassic plain. The clear
water of the upland becks and the plentiful supply of water-power
led to the founding of small paper-mills in remote valleys before
the days of steam, and some of these primitive establishments still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>412</span>
exist. The prosperity and great population of the Pennine region
date from the discovery that pit-coal could smelt iron as well as
charcoal; and this source of power once discovered, the people bred
in the dales developed a remarkable genius for mechanical invention
and commercial enterprise, which revolutionized the economic
life of the world and changed England from an agricultural to an
industrial country. The staple industry of the district in ancient
times was sheep-rearing, and the villages in nearly all the dales
carried on a small manufacture of woollen cloth. The introduction
of cotton caused the woollen manufactures on the western side to be
superseded by the working up of the imported raw material; but
woollen manufactures, themselves carried on now almost entirely
with imported raw material, have continued to employ the energies
of the inhabitants of the east. Some quiet market-towns, such as
Skipton and Keighley, remain, but most of them have developed
by manufactures into great centres of population, lying, as a rule,
at the junction of thickly peopled valleys, and separated from one
another by the empty uplands. Such are Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield,
Huddersfield and Halifax on the great and densely peopled West
Riding coal-field, which lies on the eastern slope of the Pennines.
The iron ores of the Coal Measures have given rise to great manufactures
of steel, from cutlery to machinery and armour-plates.
High on the barren crest of the Pennines, where the rocks yield no
mineral wealth, except it be medicinal waters, Harrogate, Buxton
and Matlock are types of health resorts, prosperous from their
pure air and fine scenery. Across the moors, on the western side
of the anticline, the vast and dense population of the Lancashire
coal-field is crowded in the manufacturing towns surrounding the
great commercial centre, Manchester, which itself stands on the edge
of the Triassic plain. Ashton, Oldham, Rochdale, Bury, Bolton and
Wigan form a nearly confluent semicircle of great towns, their prosperity
founded on the underlying coal and iron, maintained by
imported cotton. The Lancashire coal-field, and the portion of the
bounding plain between it and the seaport of Liverpool, contain a
population greater than that borne by any equal area in the country,
the county of London and its surroundings not excepted. In the
south-west of the Pennine region the coal-field of North Staffordshire
supports the group of small but active towns known collectively
from the staple of their trade as &ldquo;The Potteries.&rdquo; On the north-east
the great coal-field of Northumberland and Durham, traversed midway
by the Tyne, supports the manufactures of Newcastle and its
satellite towns, and leaves a great surplus for export from the
Tyne ports.</p>

<p><i>Wales.</i>&mdash;The low island of Anglesey, which is built up of the
fundamental Archaean rocks, is important as a link in the main
line of communication with Ireland, because it is separated from
the mainland by a channel narrow enough to be bridged, and lies
not far out of the straight line joining London and Dublin. The
mainland of Wales rises into three main highlands, the mountain
groups of North, Mid and South Wales, connected together by
land over 1000 ft. in elevation in most places, but separated by
valleys affording easy highways. The streams of the southern and
western slopes are short and many, flowing directly to the Bristol
Channel and the Irish Sea; but the no less numerous streams of
the eastern slopes gather themselves into three river systems, and
reach the sea as the Dee, the Severn and the Wye. The mountain
group of <i>North Wales</i> is the largest and loftiest; its scenery resembles
that of the Scottish Highlands because of the juxtaposition of
ancient Palaeozoic rocks&mdash;Cambrian and Ordovician, often altered
into slate&mdash;and contemporaneous volcanic outbursts and igneous
intrusions. Here rises the peak of Snowdon (3560 ft.), the culminating
point of South Britain, and near it half a dozen summits exceed
3000 ft., while Cader Idris, farther south, though slightly lower,
presents a singularly imposing outline. The mild winter climate
has fringed the coast with seaside resorts, the rugged heights
attract tourists in summer, and the vast masses of slate have given
rise to the largest slate quarries in the world. The heavy rainfall
of the upper valleys unfits them for agriculture, and the farms are
poor. There are several lakes: that of Bala being the largest,
except the old lake of Vyrnwy, reconstituted artificially to store
the rainfall for the water-supply of Liverpool, 68 m. distant. The
Vyrnwy is tributary to the Severn; but north of it the streams
gather into the Dee, and flow eventually northward. <i>Mid Wales</i> is
built up, for the most part, of Silurian or Ordovician rocks, practically
free from igneous intrusions except in the south-west. There the
resistance of a series of igneous dykes gives prominence to the
Pembroke peninsula, in which the fine fjord-like harbour of Milford
Haven lies far out towards the Atlantic. The coast north of Pembroke
and Merioneth has been worked into the grand sweep of
Cardigan Bay, its surface carved into gently rounded hills, green
with rich grass, which sweep downward into wide rounded valleys.
Plinlimmon (2468 ft.) is the highest of the hills, and forms a sort of
hydrographic centre for the group, as from its eastern base the
Severn and the Wye take their rise&mdash;the former describing a wide
curve to east and south, the latter forming a chord to the arc in its
southward course. Mid Wales is mainly a pastoral country, and
very thinly peopled. A group of artificial lakes, one of them exceeded
in area only by Windermere, has been formed in the valley of the
Elan, a tributary of the Wye, for the supply of water to Birmingham.
The group of heights of <i>South Wales</i>, running on the whole from
west to east, marks the outcrops of the Old Red Sandstone and
Carboniferous strata which lie within a vast syncline of the Silurian
rocks. The Brecon Beacons of Old Red Sandstone are the highest
(2907 ft.), but the Black Mountain bears a number of picturesque
summits carved out of Millstone Grit and Carboniferous Limestone,
which rise frequently over 2000 ft. Throughout Hereford, and in
part of Monmouthshire, the Old Red Sandstone sinks to a great undulating
plain, traversed by the exquisite windings of the Wye, and
forming some of the richest pasture and fruit lands of England.
This plain formed an easy passage from south to north, and since the
time of the Romans was a strategical line of the greatest importance,
a fact which has left its traces on the present distribution of towns.
Around the western and northern edge of the Old Red Sandstone
plain the underlying Silurian rocks (and even the Cambrian and
Archaean in places) have been bent up so that their edges form hills
of singular abruptness and beauty. Of these are the Malvern Hills,
east of Hereford, and in particular the hills of Shropshire. Wenlock
Edge, running from south-west to north-east, is an escarpment
of Silurian limestone, while the broad upland of Long Mynd, nearly
parallel to it on the north, is a mass of Archaean rock. The Wrekin,
the Caradoc and Cardington Hills are isolated outbursts of pre-Cambrian
volcanic rocks. The outer rim of the Welsh area contains
a broken series of coal-fields, where patches of Carboniferous strata
come to the surface on the edge of the New Red Sandstone plain.
Such are the coal-fields of Flint in the north, the Forest of Wyre
and the Forest of Dean, close to the Severn, on the east. The great
coal-field on the south is a perfect example of a synclinal basin,
the Millstone Grit and Carboniferous Limestone which underlie the
Coal Measures appearing all round the margin. This coal-field
occupies practically the whole of Glamorgan and part of Monmouth,
and its surface slopes from the Black Mountain and Brecon Beacons
to the sea as a gently inclined plateau, scored by deep valleys draining
south. Each chief valley has a railway connecting a string of mining
villages, and converging seaward to the busy ports of Newport,
Cardiff and Barry (a town created on a sandy island by the excavation
of a great dock to form an outlet for the mines). In the north
of the field, where the limestone crops out and supplies the necessary
flux, Merthyr Tydfil has become great through iron-smelting; and
in the west Swansea is the chief centre in the world for copper and
tin smelting. The unity and ruggedness of the highlands of Wales
have proved sufficient to isolate the people from those of the rest
of South Britain, and to preserve a purely Celtic race, still very largely
of Celtic speech.</p>

<p><i>Cornwall and Devon.</i>&mdash;The peninsula of Cornwall and Devon may
be looked upon as formed from a synclinal trough of Devonian
rocks, which appear as plateaus on the north and south, while the
centre is occupied by Lower Carboniferous strata at a lower level.
The northern coast, bordering the Bristol Channel, is steep, with
picturesque cliffs and deep bays or short valleys running into the
high land, each occupied by a little seaside town or village. The
plateau culminates in the barren heathy upland of Exmoor, which
slopes gently southward from a general elevation of 1600 ft., and is
almost without inhabitants. The Carboniferous rocks of the centre
form a soil which produces rich pasture under the heavy rainfall
and remarkably mild and equable temperature, forming a great
cattle-raising district. The Devonian strata on the south do not
form such lofty elevations as those on the north, and are in consequence,
like the plain of Hereford, very fertile and peculiarly adapted
for fruit-growing and cider-making. The remarkable features of the
scenery of South Devon and Cornwall are due to a narrow band of
Archaean rock which appears in the south of the peninsulas terminating
in Lizard Head and Start Point, and to huge masses of granite
and other eruptive rocks which form a series of great bosses and
dykes. The largest granite boss gives relief to the wild upland of
Dartmoor, culminating in High Willhays and Yes Tor. The clay
resulting from the weathering of the Dartmoor granite has formed
marshes and peat bogs, and the desolation of the district has been
emphasized by the establishment in its midst of a great convict
prison, and in its northern portion of a range for artillery practice.
The Tamar flows from north to south on the Devonian plain, which
lies between Dartmoor on the east and the similar granitic boss of
Bodmin Moor (where Brown Willy rises to 1345 ft.) on the west.
There are several smaller granite bosses, of which the mass of Land&rsquo;s
End is the most important. Most of the Lizard peninsula, the only
part of England stretching south of 50° N., is a mass of serpentine.
The great variety of the rocks which meet the sea along the south of
Cornwall and Devon has led to the formation of a singularly picturesque
coast&mdash;the headlands being carved from the hardest igneous
rocks, the bays cut back in the softer Devonian strata. The fjord-like
inlets of Falmouth, Plymouth and Dartmouth are splendid natural
harbours, which would have developed great commercial ports but
for their remoteness from the centres of commerce and manufactures.
China clay from the decomposing granites; tin and copper ore,
once abounding at the contacts between the granite and the rocks
it pierced, were the former staples of wealth, and the mining largely
accounts for the exceptional density of population in Cornwall.
Fishing has always been important, the numerous good harbours
giving security to fishing-boats; and the fact that this coast is the
mildest and almost the sunniest, though by no means the driest,
part of Great Britain has led to the establishment of many health
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id="page413"></a>413</span>
resorts, of which Torquay is the chief. The old Cornish language of
the Celtic stock became extinct only in the 18th century, and the
Cornish character remains as a heritage of the time when the land
had leisure to mould the life and the habits of the man. Projecting
farthest of all England into the Atlantic, it is not surprising that the
West country has supplied a large proportion of the great naval
commanders in British history, and of the crews of the navy.</p>

<div class="center pt2"><img style="width:850px; height:610px" src="images/img412a.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="noind f80"><a href="images/img412a1.jpg">(Click to enlarge.)</a></p>

<p class="pt2">Between the separate uplands there extends a plain of Permian
and Triassic rocks, which may conveniently be considered as an
intermediate zone between the two main divisions.
To the eye it forms an almost continuous plain with
<span class="sidenote">The midland plain.</span>
the belt of Lias clays, which is the outer border of the
Eastern Division; for although a low escarpment marks the line of
junction, and seems to influence the direction of the main rivers,
there is only one plain so far as regards free movement over its
surface and the construction of canals, roads and railways. The
plain usually forms a distinct border along the landward margins
of the uplands of more ancient rock, though to the east of the
Cornwall-Devon peninsula it is not very clear, and its continuity in
other places is broken by inliers of the more ancient rocks, which
everywhere underlie it. One such outcrop of Carboniferous Limestone
in the south forms the Mendip Hills; another of the Coal
Measures increases the importance of Bristol, where it stands at the
head of navigation on the southern Avon. In the north-west a
tongue of the Red rocks forms the Eden valley, separating the Lake
District from the Pennine Chain, with Carlisle as its central town.
Farther south, these rocks form the low coastal belt of Lancashire,
edged with the longest stretches of blown sand in England, and
dotted here and there with pleasure towns, like Blackpool and Southport.
The plain sweeps round south of the Lancashire coal-field,
forms the valley of the Mersey from Stockport to the sea, and farther
south in Cheshire the salt-bearing beds of the Keuper marls give
rise to a characteristic industry. The plain extends through Staffordshire
and Worcester, forming the lower valley of the Severn. The
greater part of Manchester, all Liverpool and Birkenhead, and innumerable
busy towns of medium size, which in other parts of
England would rank as great centres of population, stand on this
soil. Its flat surface and low level facilitate the construction of
railways and canals, which form a closer network over it than in
other parts of the country. The great junction of Crewe, where
railways from south-east, south-west, east, west and north converge,
is thus explained. South of the Pennines, the Red rocks extend
eastward in a great sweep through the south of Derbyshire, Warwick,
the west of Leicestershire, and the east of Nottingham, their margin
being approximately marked by the Avon, flowing south-west, and
the Soar and Trent, flowing north-east. South and east of these
streams the very similar country is on the Lias clay. Several small
coal-fields rise through the Red rocks&mdash;the largest, between Stafford
and Birmingham, forms the famous &ldquo;Black Country,&rdquo; with Wolverhampton
and Dudley as centres, where the manufacture of iron has
preserved a historic continuity, for the great Forest of Arden supplied
charcoal until the new fuel from the pits took its place. This coal-field,
ministering to the multifarious metal manufactures of Birmingham,
constitutes the centre of the Midlands. Smaller patches of the
Coal Measures appear near Tamworth and Burton, while deep shafts
have been sunk in many places through the overlying Triassic strata
to the coal below, thus extending the mining and manufacturing area
beyond the actual outcrop of the Coal Measures. A few small
outcrops occur where still more ancient strata have been raised to
the surface, as, for instance, in Charnwood Forest, where the Archaean
rocks, with intrusions of granite, create a patch of highland scenery
in the very heart of the English plain; and in the Lickey Hills, near
Birmingham, where the prominent features are due to volcanic
rocks of very ancient date. The &ldquo;Waterstones,&rdquo; or Lower Keuper
Sandstones,&mdash;forming gentle elevations above the softer marls, and
usually charged with an abundant supply of water, which can be
reached by wells,&mdash;form the site of many towns, such as Birmingham,
Warwick and Lichfield, and of very numerous villages. The plain
as a whole is fertile and undulating, rich in woods and richer in
pasture: the very heart of rural England. Cattle-grazing is the
chief farm industry in the west, sheep and horse-rearing in the
east; the prevalence of the prefix &ldquo;Market&rdquo; in the names of the
rural towns is noticeable in this respect. The manufacture of
woollen and leather goods is a natural result of the raising of live
stock; Leicester, Coventry and Nottingham are manufacturing
towns of the region. The historic castles, the sites of ancient battles,
and the innumerable mansions of the wealthy, combine to give to
central England a certain aesthetic interest which the more purely
manufacturing districts of the west and north fail to inspire. The
midland plain curves northward between the outcrop of the Dolomite
on the west and the Oolitic heights on the east. It sinks lowest
where the estuary of the Humber gathers in its main tributaries,
and the greater part of the surface is covered with recent alluvial
deposits. The Trent runs north in the southern half of this plain,
the Ouse runs south through the northern half, which is known as the
Vale of York, lying low between the Pennine heights on the west and
the Yorkshire moors on the east. Where the plain reaches the sea,
the soft rocks are cut back into the estuary of the Tees, and there
Middlesbrough stands at the base of the Moors. The quiet beauty of
the rural country in the south, where the barren Bunter pebble-beds
have never invited agriculture, and where considerable vestiges of the
old woodland still remain in and near Sherwood Forest, has attracted
so many seats of the landed aristocracy as to earn for that part the
familiar name of &ldquo;the Dukeries.&rdquo; The central position of York in
the north made it the capital of Roman Britain in ancient times,
and an important railway junction in our own.</p>

<p>Five natural regions may be distinguished in the Eastern Division
of England, by no means so sharply marked off as those of the west,
but nevertheless quite clearly characterized. The first
is the Jurassic Belt, sweeping along the border of the
<span class="sidenote">The eastern division.</span>
Triassic plain from the south coast at the mouth of the
Exe to the east coast at the mouth of the Tees. This is
closely followed on the south-east by the Chalk country, occupying
the whole of the rest of England except where the Tertiary Basins
of London and Hampshire cover it, where the depression of the Fenland
carries it out of sight, and where the lower rocks of the Weald
break through it. Thus the Chalk appears to run in four diverging
fingers from the centre or palm on Salisbury Plain, other formations
lying wedge-like between them. Various lines of reasoning unite in
proving that the Mesozoic rocks of the south rest upon a mass of
Palaeozoic rocks, which lies at no very great depth beneath the surface
of the anticlinal axis running from the Bristol Channel to the Strait
of Dover. The theoretical conclusion has been confirmed by the
discovery of Coal Measures, with workable coal seams, at Dover at
a depth of 2000 ft. below the surface.</p>

<p>The Eastern Division is built up of parallel strata, the edges
of the harder rocks forming escarpments, the sheets of clay forming
plains; and on this account similar features are repeated in each
of the successive geological formations. The rivers exhibit a remarkably
close relation to the geological structure, and thus contrast
with the rivers of the Western Division. There are two main classes
of river-course&mdash;those flowing down the dip-slopes at right angles
to the strike, and cutting through opposed escarpments by deep
valleys, and those following the line of strike along a bed of easily
eroded rock. A third class of streams, tributary to the second,
flows down the steep face of the escarpments. By the study of the
adjustment of these rivers to their valleys, and of the relation of the
valleys to the general structure, Professor W. M. Davis has elaborated
a theory of river classification, and a scheme of the origin of surface-features
which is attractive in its simplicity. The Thames is the one
great river of the division, rising on the Jurassic Belt, crossing the
Chalk country, and finishing its course in the Tertiary London Basin,
towards which, in its prevailing west-to-east direction, it draws its
tributaries from north and south. The other rivers are shorter,
and flow either to the North Sea on the east, or to the English
Channel on the south. With the exception of the Humber, they
all rise and pursue their whole course within the limits of the Eastern
Division itself.</p>

<p>The Eastern Division is the richest part of England agriculturally,
it is the part most accessible to trade with the Continent, and that
least adapted for providing refuges for small bodies of men in conflict
with powerful invaders. Hence the latest of the conquerors,
the Saxon and other Germanic tribes, obtained an easy mastery,
and spread over the whole country, holding their own against
marauding Northmen, except on the northern part of the east
coast; and even after the political conquest by the Normans,
continuing to form the great mass of the population, though influenced
not a little by the fresh blood and new ideas they had
assimilated. The present population is so distributed as to show
remarkable dependence on the physical features. The chalk and
limestone plateaus are usually almost without inhabitants, and the
villages of these districts occur grouped together in long strings,
either in drift-floored valleys in the calcareous plateaus, or along
the exposure of some favoured stratum at their base. In almost
every case the plain along the foot of an escarpment bears a line
of villages and small towns, and on a good map of density of population
the lines of the geological map may be readily discerned.</p>

<p><i>The Jurassic Belt.</i>&mdash;The Jurassic belt is occupied by the counties
of Gloucester, Oxford, Buckingham, Bedford, Northampton,
Huntingdon, Rutland, Lincoln and the North Riding of Yorkshire.
The rocks of the belt may be divided into two main groups: the
Lias beds, which come next to the Triassic plain, and the Oolitic
beds. Each group is made up of an alternation of soft marls or clays
and hard limestones or sandstones. The low escarpments of the
harder beds of the Lias are the real, though often scarcely perceptible,
boundary between the Triassic plain and the Jurassic belt. They
run along the right bank of the Trent in its northward course to the
Humber, and similarly direct the course of the Avon southward to
the Severn. The great feature of the region is the long line of the
Oolitic escarpment, formed in different places by the edges of different
beds of rock. The escarpment runs north from Portland Island on
the English Channel, curves north-eastward as the Cotteswold Hills,
rising abruptly from the Severn plain to heights of over 1000 ft.;
it sinks to insignificance in the Midland counties, is again clearly
marked in Lincolnshire, and rises in the North Yorkshire moors
to its maximum height of over 1500 ft. Steep towards the west,
where it overlooks the low Lias plain as the Oolitic escarpment,
the land falls very gently in slopes of Oxford Clay towards the
Cretaceous escarpments on the south and east. Throughout its
whole extent it yields valuable building-stone, and in the Yorkshire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>414</span>
moors the great abundance of iron ore has created the prosperity of
Middlesbrough, on the plain below. The Lias plain is rich grazing
country, the Oxford Clay forms valuable agricultural land, yielding
heavy crops of wheat. The towns of the belt are comparatively
small, not one attains a population of 75,000, and the favourite
site is on the Lias plain below the great escarpment. They are for
the most part typical rural market-towns, the manufactures, where
such exist, being usually of agricultural machinery, or woollen and
leather goods. Bath, Gloucester, Oxford, Northampton, Bedford,
Rugby, Lincoln and Scarborough are amongst the chief. North
of the gap in the low escarpment in which the town of Lincoln
centres, a close fringe of villages borders the escarpment on the
west; and throughout the belt the alternations of clay and hard
rock are reflected in the grouping of population.</p>

<p><i>The Chalk Country.</i>&mdash;The dominating surface-feature formed by
the Cretaceous rocks is the Chalk escarpment, the northern edge
of the great sheet of chalk that once spread continuously over the
whole south-east. It appears as a series of rounded hills of no great
elevation, running in a curve from the mouth of the Axe to Flamborough
Head, roughly parallel with the Oolitic escarpment. Successive
portions of this line of heights are known as the Western
Downs, the White Horse Hills, the Chiltern Hills, the East Anglian
Ridge, the Lincolnshire Wolds and the Yorkshire Wolds. The
rivers from the gentle southern slopes of the Oolitic heights pass by
deep valleys through the Chalk escarpments, and flow on to the
Tertiary plains within. The typical scenery of the Chalk country
is unrelieved by small streams of running water; the hills rise
into rounded downs, often capped with fine clumps of beech, and
usually covered with thin turf, affording pasture for sheep. The
chalk, when exposed on the surface, is an excellent foundation
for roads, and the lines of many of the Roman &ldquo;streets&rdquo; were
probably determined by this fact. The Chalk country extends over
part of Dorset, most of Wiltshire, a considerable portion of Hampshire
and Oxfordshire, most of Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire,
the west of Norfolk and Suffolk, the east of Lincolnshire, and the
East Riding of Yorkshire. From the upland of Salisbury Plain,
which corresponds to the axis of the anticline marking the centre of
the double fold into which the strata of the south of England have
been thrown, the great Chalk escarpment runs north-eastward;
fingers of Chalk run eastward one each side of the Weald, forming the
North and South Downs, while the southern edge of the Chalk
sheet appears from beneath the Tertiary strata at several places on
the south coast, and especially in the Isle of Wight. Flamborough
Head, the South Foreland, Beachy Head and the Needles are
examples of the fine scenery into which chalk weathers where it
fronts the sea, and these white cliffs gave to the island its early
name of Albion. The Chalk is everywhere very thinly peopled,
except where it is thickly covered with boulder clay, and so becomes
fertile, or where it is scored by drift-filled valleys, in which the
small towns and villages are dotted along the high roads. The
thickest covering of drift is found in the Holderness district of
Yorkshire, where, from the chalk cliffs of Flamborough Head to
the sandspit of Spurn Point, the whole coast is formed of boulder-clay
resting on chalk. Of the few towns in the Chalk country, the
interest of which is largely historical or scholastic, Salisbury, Winchester,
Marlborough and Cambridge are the most distinguished.
Reading flourishes from its position on the edge of the London
Tertiary Basin, Croydon is a suburb of London, and Hull, though
on the Chalk, derives its importance from the Humber estuary,
which cuts through the Chalk and the Jurassic belts, to drain the
Triassic plain and the Pennine region. The narrow strip of Greensands
appearing from beneath the Chalk escarpment on its northern
side is crowded with small towns and villages on account of the
plentiful water-supply. The distinction between the low grounds of
the Jurassic belt and the Chalk country is not always very apparent
on the surface, and from the historic point of view it is important
to recognize the individuality of the Eastern plain which extends
from the Vale of York across the Humber and the Wash into Essex.
The Eastern plain thus includes a portion of the Triassic plain in
the north, a portion of the Jurassic and Chalk belts in the middle,
and a portion of the Tertiary plain of the London Basin in the
south.</p>

<p><i>The Fenland.</i>&mdash;The continuity of the belts of Chalk and of the
Middle and Upper Oolites in the Eastern Plain is broken by the
shallow depression of the Wash and the Fenland. The Fenland
comprises a strip of Norfolk, a considerable part of Cambridgeshire,
and the Holland district of Lincoln. Formerly a great inlet with
vague borders of lagoons and marshes, the Fenland has been reclaimed
partly by natural processes, partly by engineering works
patiently continued for centuries. The whole district is flat and low,
for the most part within 15 ft. of sea-level; the seaward edge in
many places is below the level of high tide, and is protected by dykes
as in Holland, while straight canals and ditches carry the sluggish
drainage from the land. The soil is composed for the most part of
silt and peat. A few small elevations of gravel, or of underlying
formations, rise above the level of 25 ft.; these were in former
times islands, and now they form the sites of the infrequent villages.
Boston and King&rsquo;s Lynn are memorials of the maritime importance
of the Wash in the days of small ships. The numerous ancient
churches and the cathedrals of Ely and Peterborough bear witness
to the share taken by religious communities in the reclamation
and cultivation of the land.</p>

<p><i>The Weald.</i>&mdash;The dissection of the great east and west anticline
in the south-east of England has resulted in a remarkable piece of
country, occupying the east of Hampshire and practically the whole
of Sussex, Surrey and Kent, in which each geological stratum
produces its own type of scenery, and exercises its own specific
influence on every natural distribution. The sheet of Chalk shows
its cut edges in the escarpments facing the centre of the Weald,
and surrounding it in an oval ring, the eastern end of which is broken
by the Strait of Dover, so that its completion must be sought in
France. From the crest of the escarpment, all round on south,
west and north, the dip-slope of the Chalk forms a gentle descent
outwards, the escarpment a very steep slope inwards. The cut
edges of the escarpment forming the Hog&rsquo;s Back and North Downs
on the north, and the South Downs on the south, meet the sea in the
fine promontories of the South Foreland and Beachy Head. The
Downs are almost without population, waterless and grass-covered,
with patches of beech wood. Their only important towns are on the
coast, <i>e.g.</i> Brighton, Eastbourne, Dover, Chatham, or in the gaps
where rivers from the centre pierce the Chalk ring, as at Guildford,
Rochester, Canterbury, Lewes and Arundel. Within the Chalk ring,
and at the base of the steep escarpment, there is a low terrace of the
Upper Greensand, seldom so much as a mile in width, but in most
places crowded with villages scarcely more than a mile apart, and
ranged like beads on a necklace. Within the Upper Greensand an
equally narrow ring of Gault is exposed, its stiff clay forming level
plains of grazing pasture, without villages, and with few farmhouses
even; and from beneath it the successive beds of the Lower Greensand
rise towards the centre, forming a wider belt, and reaching a considerable
height before breaking off in a fine escarpment, the crest
of which is in several points higher than the outer ring of Chalk.
Leith Hill and Hindhead are parts of this edge in the west, where
the exposure is widest. Several towns have originated in the gaps
of the Lower Greensand escarpment which are continuous with
those through the Chalk: such are Dorking, Reigate, Maidstone
and Ashford. Folkestone and Pevensey stand where the two
ends of the broken ring meet the sea. It is largely a region of
oak and pine trees, in contrast to the beech of the Chalk Downs.
The Lower Greensand escarpment looks inwards in its turn over
the wide plain of Weald Clay, along which the Medway flows in the
north, and which forms a fertile soil, well cultivated, and particularly
rich in hops and wheat. The primitive forests have been largely
cleared, the primitive marshes have all been drained, and now
the Weald Clay district is fairly well peopled and sprinkled with
villages. From the middle of this plain the core of Lower Cretaceous
sandstones known as the Hastings Beds emerges steeply, and
reaches in the centre an elevation of 796 ft. at Crowborough Beacon.
It is on the whole a region with few streams, and a considerable
portion of the ancient woodland still remains in Ashdown Forest.
The greater part of the Forest Ridges is almost without inhabitants.
Towns are found only round the edge bordering the Weald Clay,
such as Tonbridge, Tunbridge Wells and Horsham; and along the
line where it is cut off by the sea, <i>e.g.</i> Hastings and St Leonards.
The broad low tongue of Romney Marsh running out to Dungeness
is a product of shore-building by the Channel tides, attached to the
Wealden area, but not essentially part of it.</p>

<p><i>The London Basin.</i>&mdash;The London Basin occupies a triangular
depression in the Chalk which is filled up with clays and gravels
of Tertiary and later age. It extends from the eastern extremity
of Wiltshire in a widening triangle to the sea, which it meets along
an irregular line from Deal to Cromer. It thus occupies parts of
Wiltshire, Hampshire, Surrey, Kent, Berkshire, Hertfordshire, the
whole of Middlesex, the county of London and Essex, and the eastern
edge of Suffolk and Norfolk. The scenery is quiet in its character,
but the gravel hills are often prominent features, as at Harrow and
in the northern suburbs of London; the country is now mainly
under grass or occupied with market and nursery gardens, and
many parts, of which Epping Forest is a fine example, are still
densely wooded, the oak being the prevailing tree. The coast is
everywhere low and deeply indented by ragged and shallow estuaries,
that of the Thames being the largest. Shallow lagoons formed
along the lower courses of the rivers of Norfolk have given to that
part of the country the name of the Broads, a district of low and
nearly level land. Apart from the huge area of urban and suburban
London, the London Basin has few large towns. Norwich and
Ipswich, Yarmouth, Lowestoft, Harwich and Colchester may be
mentioned in the north-eastern part, all depending for their prosperity
on agriculture or on the sea; and a fringe of summer resorts
on the low coast has arisen on account of the bracing climate.
Reading and Windsor lie in the western portion, beyond the suburban
sphere of London. The Bagshot Beds in the west form
infertile tracts of sandy soil, covered with heath and pine, where
space is available for the great camps and military training-grounds
round Aldershot, and for the extensive cemeteries at Woking.
The London Clay in the east is more fertile and crowded with
villages, while the East Anglian portion of the basin consists of the
more recent Pliocene sands and gravels, which mix with the boulder
clay to form the best wheat-growing soil in the country.</p>

<p><i>The Hampshire Basin.</i>&mdash;The Hampshire Basin forms a triangle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>415</span>
with Dorchester, Salisbury and Worthing near the angles, and the
rim of Chalk to the south appears in broken fragments in the Isle
of Purbeck, the Isle of Wight, and to the east of Bognor. On the
infertile Bagshot Beds the large area of the New Forest remains
untilled under its ancient oaks. The London Clay of the east is
more fertile, but the greatness of this district lies in its coast-line,
which is deeply indented, like that of the London Basin. Southampton
and Portsmouth have gained importance through their fine
natural harbours, improved by engineering works and fortifications;
Bournemouth and Bognor, from their favourable position in the
sunniest belt of the country, as health resorts.</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;The configuration of England, while sufficiently
pronounced to allow of the division of the country into natural
regions, is not strongly enough marked to exercise any very great
influence upon lines of communication. The navigable rivers are
all connected by barge-canals, even across the Pennine Chain.
Although the waterways are much neglected, compared with those
of France or of Germany, they might still be very useful if they
were enlarged and improved and if free competition with railways
could be secured. The main roads laid out as arteries of intercommunication
by the Romans, suffered to fall into neglect, and
revived in the coaching days of the beginning of the 19th century,
fell into a second period of comparative neglect when the railway
system was completed; but they have recovered a very large share
of their old importance in consequence of the development of motor-traffic.
Following the Roman roads, the high roads of the Eastern
Division very frequently run along the crests of ridges or escarpments;
but in the Western Division they are, as a rule, forced by
the more commanding relief of the country to keep to the river
valleys and cross the rougher districts through the dales and passes.
The railways themselves, radiating from the great centres of population,
and especially from London, are only in a few instances much
affected by configuration. The Pennine Chain has always separated
the traffic from south to north into an east coast route through the
Vale of York, and a west coast route by the Lancashire plain.
The Midland railway, running through the high and rugged country
between the two, was the last to be constructed. The most notable
bridges over navigable water affording continuous routes are those
across Menai Strait, the Tyne at Newcastle, the Severn at Severn
Bridge and the Manchester Ship Canal. It is more usual to tunnel
under such channels, and the numerous Thames tunnels, the Mersey
tunnel between Liverpool and Birkenhead, and the Severn tunnel,
the longest in the British Islands (4½ m.), on the routes from London
to South Wales, and from Bristol to the north of England, are all
important. The Humber estuary is neither bridged nor tunnelled
below Goole.</p>

<p><i>Density of Population.</i>&mdash;The present distribution of population
over England and Wales shows a dense concentration at all large
seaports, in the neighbourhood of London, and on the coal-fields
where manufactures are carried on. Agricultural areas are very
thinly peopled; purely pastoral districts can hardly be said to have
any settled population at all. There are very few dwellings situated
at a higher level than 1000 ft., and on the lower ground the Chalk
and the Oolitic limestones, where they crop out on the surface,
are extremely thinly peopled, and so as a rule are areas of alluvial
deposits and the Tertiary sands. But, on the other hand, the
broad clay plains of all formations, the Cretaceous sandstones, and
the Triassic plain, are peopled more densely than any other district
without mineral wealth or sea trade.</p>

<p><i>Political Divisions.</i>&mdash;In the partition of England and Wales into
counties, physical features play but a small part. The forty ancient
counties, remnants of various historical groupings and partings,
are occasionally bounded by rivers. Thus the Thames divides
counties along nearly its whole length, forming the southern
boundary of four and the northern boundary of three. Essex and
Suffolk, Suffolk and Norfolk, Cornwall and Devon, Durham and
Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cheshire, are all separated by rivers,
while rivers form some part of the boundaries of almost every county.
Still, it is noteworthy that the Severn and Trent nowhere form
continuous county boundaries. Watersheds are rarely used as
boundaries for any distance; but, although slightly overlapping
the watershed on all sides, Yorkshire is very nearly coincident
with the basin of the Ouse. The boundaries of the parishes, the
fundamental units of English political geography, are very often
either rivers or watersheds, and they frequently show a close relation
to the strike of the geological strata. The hundreds, or groups of
parishes, necessarily share their boundaries, and groups of hundreds
are often aggregated to form larger subdivisions of counties. A
wider grouping according to natural characteristics may now be
recognized only in the cases of Wales, East Anglia, Wessex and such
less definite groups as the Home Counties around London or the
Midlands around Birmingham. Configuration is only one out of
many conditions modifying distributions, and its effects on England
as a whole appear to be suggestive rather than determinative.</p>

<div class="author">(H. R. M.)</div>

<p class="center pt2 sc">III. Geology</p>

<p>For an area so small, England is peculiarly rich in geological
interest. This is due in some degree to the energy of the early
British geologists, whose work profoundly influenced all subsequent
thought in the science, as may be seen by the general
acceptation of so many of the English stratigraphical terms; but
the natural conditions were such as to call forth and to stimulate
this energy in an unusual way. Almost every one of the principal
geological formations may be studied in England with comparative
ease.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>If we lay aside for the moment all the minor irregularities, we
find, upon examination of a geological map of England, two structural
features of outstanding importance. (1) The first is the great anticline
of the Pennine Hills which dominates the northern half of
England from the Scottish border to Derby. Its central core of
Lower Carboniferous rock is broadly displayed towards the north,
while southward it contracts; on either side lie the younger rocks,
the coal-fields, the Permian strata and the Triassic formations,
the last-named, while sweeping round the southern extremity of
the Carboniferous axis of the uplift from its eastern and western
flanks, spread out in a large sheet over the midland counties. (2)
The second striking feature is the regular succession of Jurassic
and Cretaceous rocks which crop out in almost unbroken lines from
the coast of Dorsetshire, whither they appear to converge, to the
Cleveland Hills and the Yorkshire coast. Lying upon the Cretaceous
rocks in the S.E. of England are the two Tertiary basins of London
and Hampshire, separated by the dissected anticline of the Weald.</p>

<div class="center pt2"><img style="width:521px; height:864px" src="images/img415.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="pt2">The older rocks in England occupy relatively small areas. Pre-Cambrian
rocks are represented by the gneisses of Primrose Hill
and schists of Rushton in Shropshire; by the gneisses forming the
core of the Malvern Hills, and by the ancient volcanic and other rocks
of the Wrekin, Charnwood Forest and Nuneaton. The slates of the
Long Mynd, on the Shropshire border, belong to this system. Cambrian
strata appear in Shropshire in the form of sandstones and
quartzites; in the Malvern Hills they are black shales, while in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>416</span>
Lake District they are represented by the Skiddaw slates. Next in
point of age comes the Ordovician system, which is well developed
upon the Shropshire border and in the Lake District. In the same
two areas we find the Silurian rocks, shales and limestones with
grits and flags. In N. and S. Devon are the Devonian limestones,
grits and shales; the corresponding Old Red Sandstone type of the
system (marls and sandstones) being exposed over a large part of
Herefordshire, stretching also into Shropshire and Monmouth.
Next in order of succession comes the Carboniferous system, with
shales and limestones in the lower members, grits, sandstones and
shales&mdash;the Millstone Grit series&mdash;in the middle of the system,
followed by the Coal Measures&mdash;a great series of shales with coal,
sandstones and ironstone at the top. This important system
occupies a large area in England. The limestones and shales are
well exposed in Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Northumberland, the Mendip
Hills and at Clifton. The Millstone Grit series is prominent in
Lancashire, Derbyshire, N. Staffordshire, Yorkshire and in the
Forest of Dean. The Coal Measures rest upon the Millstone Grits
in most places, generally in synclinal basins. On the eastern side
of the Pennine range are the conterminous coal-fields of Yorkshire,
Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, and the coal-field of Durham and
Northumberland; on the western side are the Whitehaven, Burnley,
S. Lancashire and N. Staffordshire coal-fields. Farther south are
the S. Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Coalbrook Dale, Forest of Wyre,
Forest of Dean and Bristol and Somerset coal-fields; while much
concealed coal lies under younger formations in the south-east of
England, as has been proved at Dover. A large part of N. Devon is
occupied by the Culm shales, limestones and grits of Carboniferous
age. The principal development of Permian rocks is the narrow
strip which extends from Nottingham to Tynemouth; here the
Magnesian limestone is the characteristic feature. On the other
side of the Pennine Hills we find the Penrith sandstone of the Vale of
Eden and the Brockram beds of the Lake District. Red sandstones
and conglomerates of this age constitute some of the red rocks
which form the picturesque scenery about Dawlish and Teignmouth.</p>

<p>The Triassic rocks, red sandstones, marls and conglomerates
cover a broad area in the Midlands in Worcestershire, Warwickshire
and Leicestershire, whence they may be followed south-westward
through Somerset to the coast at Sidmouth, and northward, round
either flank of the Pennine Hills, through Nottinghamshire and
Yorkshire to Middlesbrough on the one hand, and upon the other
through Staffordshire, Cheshire and Lancashire to Carlisle.</p>

<p>The outcrop of the Lias, mainly clay with thin limestones and
ironstones, runs in an almost continuous band across the country
from Lyme Regis, through Bath, Cheltenham, near Leicester, and
Lincoln to Redcar in Yorkshire. Closely following the same line
are the alternating clays and limestones of the Oolitic series. Next
in order come the Greensands and Gault, which lie at the base of the
Chalk escarpment, between that formation and the Oolites. The
Chalk occupies all the remaining portion of the south-east of England,
save the Wealden area, and extends northward as far as Flamborough
in Yorkshire, forming the Yorkshire Wolds, the Lincolnshire Wolds,
the Chiltern Hills, the N. and S. Downs, the Dorsetshire heights and
Salisbury Plain. But in the eastern and southern counties the
Chalk is covered by younger deposits of Tertiary age; the Pliocene
Crags of Norfolk and Suffolk, the Lower London Tertiaries (London
Clay, Woolwich and Reading Beds, &amp;c.) of the London Basin
comprising parts of Essex, Hertfordshire, Middlesex, Bucks and
Berks, and northern Kent. Again, in the Hampshire Basin and Isle
of Wight, Eocene and Oligocene formations rest upon the Chalk.</p>

<p>When we attempt to decipher the physical history of the country
from the complicated record afforded by the stratigraphical palimpsest,
we are checked at the outset by the dearth of information
from being able to picture the geographical condition in the older
Palaeozoic periods. All we can say is, that in those remote times
what is now England had no existence; its site was occupied by
seas which were tenanted by marine invertebrates, long since
extinct. As for the boundaries of these ancient seas, we can say
nothing with certainty, but it is of interest to note the evidence we
possess of still older land conditions, such as we have in the old rocks
of Shropshire, &amp;c. In the Devonian period it is clear that an
elevatory movement had set in towards the north, which gave rise
to the formation of inland lakes and narrow estuaries in which the
Old Red Sandstone rocks were formed, while in the south of England
lay the sea with a vigorous coral fauna. This condition led up to the
Carboniferous period, which began with fairly open sea over the
south and north of England, but in the centre there rose an elevated
land mass from which much of the Millstone Grit was derived;
other land lay towards the north. Slowly this sea shallowed, giving
rise to the alternating estuarine marine and freshwater deposits
of the Coal Measures. Continual elevation of the land brought about
the close of the coal-forming period and great changes ensued.
Desert conditions, with confined inland seas, marked the Permian
and Triassic periods. It was about this time that the Pennine Hills,
the Lake District mountain mass, and the Mendip Hills were being
most vigorously uplifted, while the granite masses of Cornwall
and Devon were perhaps being injected into the Carboniferous
and Devonian rocks. From this period, more or less of the Pennine
ridge has always remained above the sea, along with much of Cornwall
and parts of Devonshire.</p>

<p>In early Jurassic times the sea probably again occupied most of
England with the exception of the above-mentioned areas, the Lake
District and eastern part of the London Basin; Wales, too, and
much of Scotland were land. Elevation gradually caused more land
to appear in later Jurassic and early Cretaceous times when a river
system, now entirely obliterated, drained into the Purbeck estuary
and Wealden lake; but a subsequent depression led to the wide
extension of the Chalk sea. By the beginning of the Eocene period
we find the sea limited to the S.E. of England, where the London
Clay, &amp;c., were being laid down. It was not until quite late in
Tertiary time that these islands began to assume anything like their
present form. In the earlier part of the Pleistocene period, England
and Ireland were still incompletely severed, and the combined
activity of certain extinct rivers and the sea had not yet cut through
the land connexion with the continent. The last well-marked
lowering of the land took place in the Pleistocene period, when it
was accompanied by glacial conditions, through which the greater
part of northern England and the Midlands was covered by ice; a
state of things which led directly and indirectly to the deposition
of those extensive boulder clays, sands and gravels which obscure
so much of the older surface of the country in all but the southern
counties.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole period of its geological history, volcanic
activity has found expression with varying degrees of intensity
along what is now the western side of the island, with the exception
that in the Mesozoic era this activity was in abeyance. We may
note the pre-Cambrian lavas and tuffs of the Wrekin district in
Shropshire and the somewhat later volcanic rocks of Charnwood;
the porphyrites, andesites, tuffs and rhyolites of the Borrowdale
volcanic centre, erupted in the Ordovician period, and the Silurian
granites of the same region. The volcanic outbursts which followed
became feebler in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods and
ceased with the Permian. When again the volcanic forces became
active, it was in the early Tertiary era; the evidences for this lie
outside the English border.</p>

<p>The principal directions of crust movement in England are:
(1) north and south, by which the Pennine folds and faults, and the
Malvern Hills have been produced; (2) east and west, by which the
folds of the Weald and the Mendip Hills, and those of Devonshire
have been formed. Another less important direction is N.W. and
S.E., as in the Charnwood folding.</p>

<p>Further details of the geology are given under the heads of the
counties.</p></div>

<p class="center pt2 sc">IV. Climate</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Temperature.</i>&mdash;The mean annual temperature of the whole of
England and Wales (reduced to sea-level) is about 50° F., varying
from something over 52° in the Scilly Isles to something
under 48° at the mouth of the Tweed. The mean annual
<span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>
temperature diminishes very regularly from south-west to north-east,
the west coast being warmer than the east, so that the mean
temperature at the mouth of the Mersey is as high as that at the
mouth of the Thames. During the coldest month of the year
(January) the mean temperature of all England is about 40°. The
influence of the western ocean is very strongly marked, the temperature
falling steadily from west to east. Thus while the temperature
in the west of Cornwall is 44°, the temperature on the east coast
from north of the Humber to the Thames is under 38°, the coldest
winters being experienced in the Fenland. In the hottest month
(July) the mean temperature of England and Wales is about 61.5°,
and the westerly wind then exercises a cooling effect, the greatest
heat being found in the Thames basin immediately around London,
where the mean temperature of the month exceeds 64°; the mean
temperature along the south coast is 62°, and that at the mouth of the
Tweed a little under 59°. In the centre of the country along a line
drawn from London to Carlisle the mean temperature in July is
found to diminish gradually at an average rate of 1° per 60 m. The
coasts are cooler than the centre of the country, but the west coast
is much cooler than the east, modified continental conditions prevailing
over the North Sea. The natural effect of the heating of the
air in summer and the cooling of the air in winter by contact with
the land is largely masked in England on account of the strength
of the prevailing south-westerly wind carrying oceanic influence
into the heart of the country. This effect is well seen in the way
in which the wind blowing directly up the Severn estuary is directed
along the edges of the Oolitic escarpment north-eastward, thus displacing
the centre of cold in winter to the east coast, and the centre
of heat in summer to the lower Thames, from the position which
both centres would occupy, if calms prevailed, in a belt running
from Birmingham to Buckingham. As to how far the narrow portion
of the North Sea modifies the influence of the European continent,
there seems reason to believe that the prevailing winds blowing up
the English Channel carry oceanic conditions some distance inland,
along those parts of the continent nearest to England. The Mersey
estuary, being partly sheltered by Ireland and North Wales, does
not serve as an inlet for modifying influences to the same extent
as the Bristol Channel; and as the wind entering by it blows squarely
against the slope of the Pennine Chain, it does not much affect the
climate of the midland plain.</p>

<div class="center pt2"><img style="width:850px; height:605px" src="images/img416a.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="noind f80"><a href="images/img416a1.jpg">(Click to enlarge.)</a></p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Winds.</i>&mdash;The average barometric pressure over England is about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>417</span>
29.94 in., and normally diminishes from south-west to north-east
at all seasons, the mean pressure on the south coast being 29.97
and that on the northern border 29.88. The pressure at any given
latitude is normally highest in the centre of the country and on
the east coast, and lowest on the west coast. The direction of the
mean annual isobars shows that the normal wind in all parts of
England and Wales must be from the south-west on the west coast,
curving gradually until in the centre of the country, and on the east
coast it is westerly, without a southerly component. The normal
seasonal march of pressure-change produces a maximum gradient
in December and January, and a minimum gradient in April;
but for every month in the year the mean gradient is for winds
from southerly and westerly quarters. In April the gradient is
so slight that any temporary fall of pressure to the south of England
or any temporary rise of pressure to the north, which would suffice
in other months merely to reduce the velocity of the south-westerly
wind, is sufficient in that month to reverse the gradient and produce
an east wind over the whole country. The liability to east wind in
spring is one of the most marked features of the English climate,
the effect being naturally most felt on the east coast. The southerly
component in the wind is as a rule most marked in the winter months,
the westerly component predominating in summer. The west end
of a town receives the wind as it blows in fresh from the country at
all seasons, and consequently the west end of an English town is
with few exceptions the residential quarter, while smoke-producing
industries are usually relegated to the east end.</p>

<p><i>Storms.</i>&mdash;On account of the great frequency of cyclonic disturbances
passing in from the Atlantic, the average conditions of wind
over the British Islands give no idea of the frequency of change in
direction and force. The chief paths of depressions are from south-west
to north-east across England; one track runs across the
south-east and eastern counties, and is that followed by a large
proportion of the summer and autumn storms, thereby perhaps
helping to explain the peculiar liability of the east of England to
damage from hail accompanying thunderstorms. A second track
crosses central England, entering by the Severn estuary and leaving
by the Humber or the Wash; while a third crosses the north of
England from the neighbourhood of Morecambe Bay to the Tyne.
While these are tracks frequently followed by the centres of barometric
depressions, individual cyclones may and do cross the country
in all directions, though very rarely indeed from east to west or from
north to south.</p>

<p><i>Rainfall.</i>&mdash;The rainfall of England, being largely due to passing
cyclones, can hardly be expected to show a very close relation to the
physical features of the country, yet looked at in a general way
the relation between prevailing winds and orographic structure is
not obscure. The western or mountainous division is the wettest
at all seasons, each orographic group forming a centre of heavy
precipitation. There are few places in the Western Division where
the rainfall is less than 35 in., while in Wales, the Cornwall-Devon
peninsula, the Lake District and the southern part of the Pennine
Region the precipitation exceeds 40 in., and in Wales and the Lake
District considerable areas have a rainfall of over 60 in. In the
Eastern Division, on the other hand, an annual rainfall exceeding
30 in. is rare, and in the low ground about the mouth of the Thames
estuary and around the Wash the mean annual rainfall is less than
25 in. In the Western Division and along the south coast the driest
month is usually April or May, while in the Eastern Division it is
February or March. The wettest month for most parts of England
is October, the most noticeable exception being in East Anglia,
where, on account of the frequency of summer thunderstorms, July
is the month in which most rain falls, although October is not far
behind. In the Western Division there is a tendency for the annual
maximum of rainfall to occur later than October. It may be stated
generally that the Western Division is mild and wet in winter,
and cool and less wet in summer; while the Eastern Division
is cold and dry in winter and spring, and hot and less dry in summer
and autumn. The south coast occupies an intermediate position
between the two as regards climate. Attention has been called to
the fact that the bare rocks and steep gradients which are common
in the Western Division allow of the heavy rainfall running off the
surface rapidly, while the flat and often clayey lands of the Eastern
Division retain the scantier rainfall in the soil for a longer time,
so that for agricultural purposes the effect of the rainfall is not very
dissimilar throughout the country.</p>

<p><i>Sunshine.</i>&mdash;The distribution of sunshine is not yet fully investigated,
but it appears that the sunniest part is the extreme south
coast, where alone the total number of hours of bright sunshine
reaches an average of more than 1600 per annum. The north-east,
including the Pennine Region and the whole of Yorkshire, has less
than 1300 hours of sunshine, and a portion of North Wales is equally
cloudy. Although little more than a guess, 1375 hours may be
put down as approximately the average duration of bright sunshine
for England as a whole, which may be compared with 2600 hours
for Italy, and probably about 1200 hours for Norway.</p>

<p>For the purpose of forecasting the weather, the meteorological

<p class="center pt2 sc">V. English Place-Names</p>

<p>English place-names are of diverse origin and often extremely
corrupt in their modern form, so that the real etymology of the
names can often be discovered only by a careful comparison of
the modern form with such ancient forms as are to be found in
charters, ancient histories, and other early documents. By the
aid of these a certain amount of work has been done in the subject,
but it is still largely an unworked field. The most satisfactory
method of characterizing English place-nomenclature is to deal
with it historically and chronologically, showing the influence of
the successive nations who have borne sway in this island. The
Celtic influence is to be found scattered evenly up and down the
country so far as names of rivers and mountains are concerned;
in names of towns it is chiefly confined to the west. Roman
influence is slight but evenly distributed. English influence
is all-pervading, though in the northern and north-midland
counties this influence has been encroached upon by Scandinavian
influence. Norman influence is not confined to any
particular district.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Celtic.</i>&mdash;Though scattered notices of towns, cities and rivers in
Britain are to be found in various early Roman writers, it is not
till the time of Ptolemy (2nd century), who constructed a map of the
island, and of the itinerary of Antonine (beginning of the 3rd century)
that we have much information as to the cities and towns of Britain.
We there learn that the following place-names are ultimately of
Celtic origin:&mdash;Brougham, Catterick, York, Lincoln (<i>Lindum</i>),
Manchester (<i>Mancunium</i>), Doncaster (<i>Danum</i>), Wroxeter (<i>Viroconium</i>),
Lichfield (<i>Letocetum</i>), Gloucester (<i>Glevum</i>), Cirencester
(<i>Corinium</i>), Colchester (<i>Camulodunum</i>), London, Reculver, Richborough
(<i>Rutupiae</i>), Dover, Lymne, Isle of Wight, Dorchester
(<i>Durnovaria</i>), Sarum, Exeter (<i>Isca</i>), Brancaster (<i>Branodunum</i>),
Thanet. We also have the names of the following rivers:&mdash;Eden,
Dee, Trent, Yare, Colne, Thames, Kennet, Churne, Exe, Severn,
Tamar. Gildas, writing in the 6th century, speaks of the twenty-eight
cities of the Britons. Nennius&rsquo; <i>Historia Britonum</i> gives what
purports to be a list of these cities. Of these, excluding Welsh ones,
we may with some certainty identify Canterbury (<i>Caint</i>), Caerleon-on-Usk,
Leicester (<i>Lerion</i>), Penzelwood, Carlisle, Colchester, Grantchester
(<i>Granth</i>), London, Worcester (<i>Guveirangon</i>), Doncaster
(<i>Daun</i>), Wroxeter (<i>Guoricon</i>), Chester (<i>Legion</i>&mdash;this is Roman),
Lichfield (<i>Licitcsith</i>) and Gloucester (<i>Gloui</i>). Others less certain are
Preston-on-Humber and Manchester (<i>Manchguid</i>).</p>

<p>In modern place-names the suffix <i>don</i> often goes back to the Celtic
<i>dun</i>, a hill, <i>e.g.</i> Bredon, Everdon, but the suffix was still a living one
in Saxon times. Of river-names the vast majority are Celtic (possible
exceptions will be named later), and the same is true of mountains
and hills. The forests of Wyre, Elmet and Sel (wood), and the districts
of the Wrekin and the Peak are probably Celtic.</p>

<p><i>Roman.</i>&mdash;We do not owe entire place-names to Roman influence,
with the exception of a few such as Chester, Chester-le-Street (L.
<i>strata</i> [<i>via</i>], a road) and Caistor, but Roman influence is to be found
in many names compounded of Celtic and Roman elements. The
chief of these is the element <i>chester</i>&mdash;(L. <i>castrum</i>, a fort), <i>e.g.</i> Ebchester,
Silchester, Grantchester. Porchester is entirely Latin, but
may not have been formed till Saxon times. The form <i>caster</i> is
found in the north and east, under Scandinavian influence, <i>e.g.</i>
Tadcaster, Lancaster; and in the south-west and in the midlands
we have a group of towns with the form <i>cester</i>:&mdash;Bicester, Gloucester,
Cirencester, Worcester, Alcester, Leicester, Towcester. Exeter,
Wroxeter and perhaps Uttoxeter show the suffix in slightly different
form. In names like Chesterton, Chesterford, Chesterholm, Woodchester,
the second element shows that the names are of later English
or Scandinavian formation. In Lincoln we have a compound of
the Celtic <i>Lindum</i> and the Latin <i>colonia</i>.</p>

<p><i>Saxon.</i>&mdash;The chief suffixes of Saxon origin to be found in English
place-names are as follows (some of them being also used independently):
<i>-burgh</i>, <i>-borough</i>, <i>-bury</i> (O.E. <i>burh</i>, fortified town), <i>e.g.</i>
Burgh, Bamborough, Aylesbury, Bury; <i>-bourne</i>, <i>-borne</i>, <i>-burn</i> (O.E.

<i>-ton</i> (O.E. <i>d&#363;n</i> [Celtic], a hill), <i>e.g.</i> Huntingdon, Seckington, Edington;
<i>-ey</i>, <i>-ea</i>, <i>-y</i> (O.E. <i>&#299;g</i>, an island), <i>e.g.</i> Thorney, Mersea, Ely; <i>-fleet</i>
(O.E. <i>fleot</i>, an estuary) <i>e.g.</i> Benfleet; <i>-field</i>, <i>e.g.</i> Lichfield; <i>-ford</i>,
<i>e.g.</i> Bradford; <i>-ham</i> (O.E. <i>h&#257;m</i>, a home, and <i>hamm</i>, an enclosure);
these are not distinguished in modern English, <i>e.g.</i> Bosham, Ham;
<i>-hall</i> (O.E. <i>healh</i>, a corner), <i>e.g.</i> Riccall, Tettenhall; <i>-head</i>, <i>e.g.</i>
Gateshead; <i>-hill</i>, <i>e.g.</i> Tickhill; <i>-hurst</i> (O.E. <i>hyrst</i>, copse, wood), <i>e.g.</i>
Deerhurst; <i>-ing</i> (patronymic suffix, plural form in O.E.), <i>e.g.</i> Basing,
Reading; <i>-leigh</i>, <i>-ley</i>, <i>-lea</i> (O.E. <i>l&#275;ah</i>, meadow), <i>e.g.</i> Leigh, Stoneleigh,
Whalley; <i>-lade</i> (O.E. <i>l&#257;d</i>, path, course), <i>e.g.</i> Cricklade; <i>-land</i>,
<i>e.g.</i> Crowland; <i>-lock</i> (O.E. <i>loca</i>, enclosure), <i>e.g.</i> Porlock; <i>-minster</i>
(O.E. <i>mynster</i>, L. <i>monasterium</i>), <i>e.g.</i> Axminster, Minster; <i>-mouth</i>,
<i>e.g.</i> Exmouth; <i>-port</i> (O.E. <i>port</i>, market-town, a word of Latin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>418</span>
origin), <i>e.g.</i> Bridport; <i>-sted</i>, <i>-stead</i> (O. E. <i>stede</i>, a place), <i>e.g.</i> Stansted,
Wanstead; <i>-stone</i>, <i>-ston</i>, <i>e.g.</i> Beverstone, Sherston; <i>-staple</i> (O.E.
<i>stapol</i>, foundation), <i>e.g.</i> Barnstaple; <i>-stow</i> (O.E. <i>stow</i>, place), <i>e.g.</i>
Stow, Chepstow, Bristol (earlier Bristow); <i>-tree</i>, <i>-try</i>, <i>e.g.</i> Coventry,
Elstree, Seasalter; <i>-ton</i> (O.E. <i>t&#365;n</i>, enclosure), <i>e.g.</i> Milton; <i>-wark</i>
(O.E. <i>geweorc</i>, fortification), <i>e.g.</i> Southwark; <i>-well</i>, <i>e.g.</i> Bakewell;
<i>-wich</i>, <i>-wick</i> (O.E. <i>wic</i>, a dwelling), <i>e.g.</i> Norwich, Swanage (O.E.
Swanawic), Warwick; <i>-worth</i>, <i>-worthy</i> (O.E. <i>weorth</i>, <i>weorthig</i>, an
enclosure), <i>e.g.</i> Polesworth, Holsworthy.</p>

<p>Of river names the Blackwater, Witham, Ashburne, Swift, Washburn,
Loxly, Wythburn, Eamont are perhaps English and so also
may be the Waveney in Suffolk.</p>

<p><i>Scandinavian.</i>&mdash;The following suffixes are Scandinavian in origin,
some of them being also used independently: <i>-beck</i> (O.N. <i>bekkr</i>,
stream), <i>e.g.</i> Starbeck, Troutbeck; <i>-by</i> (O.N. <i>byr</i>, town), <i>e.g.</i> Whitby;
<i>-dale</i> (O.N. <i>dalr</i>), <i>e.g.</i> Swaledale; <i>-car(r)</i>, <i>-ker</i> (O.N. <i>kiörr</i>, marshy
ground), <i>e.g.</i> Redcar, The Carrs, Muker; <i>-fell</i> (O.N. <i>fjäll</i>, mountain),
<i>e.g.</i> Scafell; <i>-force</i>, <i>-foss</i> (O.N. <i>fors</i>, waterfall). High Force, Wilberfoss;
<i>-garth</i> (O.N. <i>garðr</i>, enclosure), <i>e.g.</i> Hoggarths; <i>-gill</i> (O.N. <i>gil</i>,
a deep narrow glen), <i>e.g.</i> Skelgill, Dungeon Ghyll; <i>-holm(e)</i> (O.N.
<i>hólmr</i>, island), <i>e.g.</i> Axholme, Durham (earlier Dunholm); <i>keld</i> (O.N.
<i>kelda</i>, well, spring), <i>e.g.</i> Threlkeld, Keld; <i>-lund</i> (O.N. <i>lundr</i>, grove),
<i>e.g.</i> Snelland, Timberland, Lound; <i>-how</i> (O.N. <i>haugr</i>, hill), <i>e.g.</i>
Greenhow; <i>-scale</i> (O.N. <i>skále</i>, hut, shed), <i>e.g.</i> Seascale; <i>-skew</i> (O.N.
<i>skógr</i>, forest), <i>e.g.</i> Litherskew; <i>-thorpe</i> (O.N. <i>þorp</i>, village), <i>e.g.</i>
Thorpe, Osgathorp; <i>-thwaite</i> (O.N. <i>þveit</i>, a piece of land), <i>e.g.</i>
Rosthwaite; <i>-toft</i> (O.N. <i>topt</i>, a green knoll), <i>e.g.</i> Toft, Langtoft;
<i>-with</i> (O.N. <i>viðr</i>, a wood), <i>e.g.</i> Blawith, Stowiths.</p>

<p>Tarn (a mountain pool), grain and sike (mountain streams) are
also Scandinavian terms.</p>

<p><i>Norman.</i>&mdash;Norman influence has not been very great in English
place-nomenclature. The number of places with pure French names
is extremely limited; a few such are Beaulieu, Belvoir, Beauchief,
Beaudesert, Beaufort, Beaumont, also Theydon <i>Bois</i>, War-<i>boys</i>.
Norman influence is marked more strongly in certain compound
place-names, where one of the elements often represents the name of
the original Norman tenant or holder, <i>e.g.</i> Thorpe <i>Mandeville</i>, <i>Helion</i>
Bumstead, Higham <i>Ferrers</i>, Swaffham <i>Bulbeck</i>, Stoke <i>Gifford</i>,
Shepton <i>Mallet</i>; similarly names like Lyme <i>Regis</i>, <i>King&rsquo;s</i> Sutton,
<i>Monks&rsquo;</i> Kirby, Zeal <i>Monachorum</i>, Milton <i>Abbas</i>, <i>Bishop&rsquo;s</i> Waltham,
<i>Prior&rsquo;s</i> Dean, Huish <i>Episcopi</i> date from feudal times. Gallicized
forms are also to be found in a few forms like Kirkby-le-Soken,
Chapel-en-le-Frith, Alsop-en-le-Dale, Barnoldby-le-Beck. Ecclesiastical
influence is to be found in such names as Aldwinkle St Peter,
Barford St Martin, Belchamp St Paul, the name of the saint being
the name either of the saint to whom the church at that place was
dedicated or the patron-saint of the monastery or abbey to whom
lands in that district belonged.</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">VI. Population</p>

<p>Until the beginning of the 19th century there existed no other
knowledge of the actual area and population of the country
but what was given in the vaguest estimates. But there can
be little doubt that the population of England and Wales
increased very slowly for centuries, owing largely to want of
intercommunication, which led to famines, more or less severe&mdash;it
being a common occurrence that, while one county, with a
good harvest, was enjoying abundance, the people of the adjoining
one were starving. The interpretation of certain figures
given in the Domesday Survey (which do not cover certain parts
of modern England nor take account of the ecclesiastical population)
is a matter of widely divergent opinion; but a total
population of one million and a half has been accepted by many
for the close of the 11th century. In 1377 the levying of a poll-tax
provides partial figures from which a total of two to two-and-a-half
millions has been deduced, but again divergent
views have been expressed as to how far the number was still
affected by the Black Death of 1348-1349. It is calculated,
on the basis of registers of births and deaths, that the population
of England and Wales numbered 5,475,000 in 1700, and 6,467,000
in 1750. From the later part of the 18th century a stronger
tendency to increase set in, and at the taking of the first census,
in 1801, it was ascertained that the population numbered
8,892,536, being&mdash;if the former estimates were approximately
correct&mdash;an increase of very nearly 2½ millions in little over
fifty years. This rate of increase was not only continued, but
came to be greatly exceeded.</p>

<p>Since the first census of 1801, regular enumerations of the
people of England and Wales have been taken every ten years.
The results of these enumerations are published in separate
volumes for each county, in a volume of summary tables, and
in a general report. In the summaries England and Wales are
treated as one, and this treatment is followed here. The
following table gives the total numbers of the population of
England and Wales at each census, together with the absolute
increase, and growth per cent, during each decennial period:&mdash;</p>

<p>Allowing for a rate of increase equivalent to that which
obtained between 1891 and 1901, the estimated population was

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;A detailed map of the distribution of population in
England and Wales<a name="fa11a" id="fa11a" href="#ft11a"><span class="sp">11</span></a> shows certain well-defined areas of very dense
population. First for consideration, though not in geographical
extent, stands the area round London, in Middlesex, Surrey, Kent,
Essex and Hertfordshire. A great proportion of this population is
purely residential, that is to say, its working members do not practise
their professions at home or close to home, but in the metropolis,
travelling a considerable distance between their residences and their
offices. Just as London, in spite of its manifold industrial interests,
is hardly to be termed a manufacturing centre, so the populous
district surrounding it is not to be termed an industrial district in the
sense in which that term is applied to the remaining regions of
dense population which fall for consideration here. London gained
its paramount importance from its favourable geographical position
in respect of the rest of England on the one hand and the Continent
on the other, and the populous district of the &ldquo;home counties&rdquo;
owes its existence to that importance; whereas other populous
districts have generally grown up at the point where some source of
natural wealth, as coal or iron, lay to hand. The great populous
area which covers south Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire,
and extends beyond them into Cheshire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire
and Nottinghamshire, is not in reality a unit. The whole of the
lowland in the south of Lancashire has almost the appearance of one
vast town, whereas among the hills of the Pennine Chain the population
crowds the valleys on either flank and leaves in the high-lying
centre some of the largest tracts of practically uninhabited country in
England. Moreover, the industries in different parts of this area
(for it is strictly an industrial area) differ completely, as will be
observed later, though coal-mining is common to all. The other
most extensive centres of dense population are the coal-mining or
manufacturing districts of Northumberland and Durham, of the
midlands (parts of Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Leicestershire),
and of South Wales and Monmouthshire; and it is in these districts,
and others smaller, but of similar character, that the greatest increase
of population has been recorded, since the extensive development of

their resources during the 19th century. Thus the preceding counties<a name="fa12a" id="fa12a" href="#ft12a"><span class="sp">12</span></a>
showed an increase, under normal conditions, exceeding 10% during
the ten years 1891-1901, the percentage of increase in 1871-1891
being given for comparison.</p>

<p>It will be observed that three of the home counties occur in the
first four in the above list. It is interesting to note, in this connexion,
that the increase of population diminished steadily, in the three
decades under notice, within the area covered by the administrative
county of London, which is only the central part of urban London
(compare the population table of the great urban districts, below).
This was 17.44% in 1871-1881, 10.39 in 1881-1891, and 7.3 in 1891-1901.
This illustrates the constant tendency for the residential districts
of a city to radiate away from its centre, which appears, though
in a modified degree, in the case of all the great English cities.</p>

<p>During the period 1891-1901 five English and five Welsh counties
showed a decrease per cent in the population. The English counties
were:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">The Welsh counties were Montgomeryshire, Cardiganshire, Flintshire,
Merionethshire and Brecknockshire, the first-named showing
the highest decrease, 5.08%, in 1891-1901. These
counties are principally agricultural, and it is in agricultural

districts elsewhere that the increase of population is
slightest. But in 1871-1881 a decrease was found in the
case of fifteen counties in all, and in 1881-1891 in the case
of thirteen, whereas in 1891-1901, although Radnorshire, which
returned a decrease previously, now returned an abnormal increase
owing to the temporary employment of workmen on the construction
of the Birmingham waterworks, the number fell to 10, and the
average percentage also fell. This suggested some tendency to
return to a state of equilibrium as between urban and rural districts.
This is in a measure borne out by the movement of population in the
districts classed as purely rural in 1901. In these there was an
increase per cent of 14.2 in 1811-1821, which fell off to 2.8 in 1841-1851.
A decrease then set in and grew from 0.2 in 1851-1861 to
0.67 in 1881-1891, but in 1891-1901 an increase, 1.95, was once
more recorded. But the drain on the rural population continued
heavy, for in the same purely rural area, which had a population in
1901 of 1,330,319, the excess of births over deaths was 150,437,
but the actual increase of population was only 25,492, leaving a heavy
loss (9.6%) to be accounted for by migration, the term used in this
connexion in the general report of the Census to include movement
of population to any new locality, home or foreign.</p>

<p><i>Housing.</i>&mdash;The total area of England and Wales covered by urban
districts (a term which coincides pretty nearly with that of towns,
which bears no technical meaning in England) was 3,848,987 acres,
and contained a population of 25,058,355 in 1901, the increase in the
decade 1891-1901 being 15.2%. The number of inhabited houses in
the whole country in 1901, namely 6,260,852, may be compared
with the numbers in 1801 (1,575,923) and 1851 (3,278,039); it gives
an average of 5.2 persons to each house. This average has decreased
with some regularity from a <i>maximum</i> of 5.75 in 1821, but there is
no certain evidence on which to affirm or deny that the average
cubic capacity of dwelling-houses has been maintained. The urban
population averaged 5.4 persons to a house, but varied greatly in
different towns. Thus, an average below 4.4 is quoted for Rochdale,
Halifax, Huddersfield, Yarmouth, Bradford and Stockport, while
the average for London was 7.93, and for Gateshead, Newcastle-upon-Tyne
and South Shields, in the northern industrial district of the
Tyne, and for Devonport, the average exceeded 8. The average
of persons to a house in rural districts was 4.6.</p>

<p><i>Vital Statistics.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;The increase or decrease of population is
governed by two factors: (1) the balance between births and deaths,
and (2) the balance between immigration and emigration.&rdquo;<a name="fa13a" id="fa13a" href="#ft13a"><span class="sp">13</span></a> The
following table is therefore given to show (1) the percentage of
increase by births and decrease by deaths in each decade from 1851,
and (2) the difference at the close of each decade (<i>i.e.</i> in the later year
mentioned in each line) between the population which would have
followed upon the natural increase unaffected by migration and the
population as actually enumerated. In the case of (2) the actual
population has always been exceeded by the estimate based on
natural increase, and this demonstrates an excess of emigration
over immigration.</p>

<p>The proportion of males to females is 1000 to 1068, this being a
higher proportion of females than any recorded in the 19th century,
during which the lowest proportion of females was 1036 in 1821.
The proportion rose at each census from 1851. But on the other
hand 1000 male children were born against only 965 female, on an
average in 1891-1901. This excess of male births, which is usual,
has been ascertained to find its equilibrium, through a higher rate
of infant mortality among the males, about the tenth year of life,
and is finally changed by perilous male occupations and other causes,
including the stronger tendency of males to emigration. The proportion
of females varies much in different localities, being highest
in such districts as London and the home counties, which are residential,
and in which, therefore, many domestic servants are enumerated;
and Somersetshire, Bedfordshire and other seats of industries
which especially occupy women (<i>e.g.</i> the straw-plaiting of the county
last named). It is lowest, naturally, in the mining districts, as
Glamorgan, Monmouth, Durham, Northumberland; but an exception
may be noted in the case of Cornwall, where a high proportion
of females is attributed to the emigration of miners consequent upon
the relative decrease in importance of the tin-mines. In 1901 the
proportion of females to males in urban districts was 1086 to 1000,
and in rural districts 1011 to 1000.</p>

<p><i>Religion.</i>&mdash;In attempting to give a concise account of the
religious conditions of England we are confronted from the
outset with the absence of any trustworthy statistics. A
religious census, such as is customary in other countries, has not
been taken since 1851; nor is it probable that such a census
would be any true indication of the actual religious beliefs of
the population. Still less satisfactory, from this standpoint,
is the attempt to compile statistics of religious belief from the
registrar-general&rsquo;s report on the number of marriages celebrated
in the places of worship of the various denominations; for among
those who are practically attached to no religious body, and
even some Nonconformists, a prejudice survives in favour of
having their marriages celebrated and their funerals conducted
by the clergy of the Established Church. Nor is the test of
&ldquo;sittings&rdquo; provided by the various denominations, nor even
the number of their communicants, a trustworthy test of the
relative number of their adherents. In Wales, for instance,
the rivalry of the sects has multiplied chapel accommodation
out of all proportion to the population; while everywhere it
happens that churches, at one time crowded every Sunday,
have been emptied by the shifting of population or other causes.
As for the test of communicancy, it is untrustworthy because
the insistence on communion as the pledge of membership varies
with the different denominations and even with different sections
of opinion within those denominations. Any statistics of this
nature, then, however useful they may be as a general indication,
must not be treated as conclusive.</p>

<p>Whatever disputes there may be as to the relative strength
of the various churches and sects, there can be no questioning
the fact that the dominant religion in England is Protestant
Christianity. Protestantism, indeed, since the Act of Settlement
in 1689, has been of the essence of the Constitution, the sovereign
forfeiting his or her crown <i>ipso facto</i> by acknowledging the
authority of the pope, by accepting &ldquo;the Romish religion,&rdquo;
or by marrying a Roman Catholic; and though of late years
efforts have been made to modify or to abrogate this provision,
the fact that such efforts have met with widespread opposition
shows that it still represents the general attitude of the British
nation. Protestantism, however, is a generic term which in
England covers a great variety of opinions, and a large number
of rival religious organizations. The state church, the Church
of England as by law established, represents the tradition of a
<span class="sidenote">The Church of England.</span>
time when church and state were regarded as two
aspects of one divinely ordered organism. In law
every subject of the state is also a member of the
Established Church, and can lay claim to its ministrations
so long as he or she obeys the ecclesiastical law, which
is also the law of the state. No Englishman, whatever his
opinions, can be excommunicated without due process of law.
The Church of England is thus theoretically coextensive with
the English nation, each unit of which is legally assumed to
belong to it unless proof be brought to the contrary. To state
the theory is, however, to risk giving an entirely false impression
of the facts. In practice the Church of England is no longer
regarded as coextensive with the state; nor is nonconformity
any longer, as it once was, an offence against the law. Since
the abolition of the Test Acts and the emancipation of the
Catholics no Englishman has suffered any civil disability owing
to his religion<a name="fa14a" id="fa14a" href="#ft14a"><span class="sp">14</span></a>; and the progress of democracy has given to
the great so-called &ldquo;Free Churches&rdquo; a political power that
rivals that of the Established Church. In the matter of the
estimation of their relative strength the main grievance of the
Nonconformists is that the law classes as members of the Church
of England that enormous floating population which is really
conscious of no ecclesiastical allegiance at all.</p>

<p>The Church of England, both in constitution and doctrine,
represents in general the mean between Roman Catholicism on
the one hand and the more advanced forms of Protestantism on
the other (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Episcopacy</a></span>). Though its doctrine was reformed
in the 16th century and the spiritual supremacy of the pope
was repudiated, the continuity of its organic life was not interrupted,
and historically as well as legally it is the same church
as that established before the Reformation. The ecclesiastical
system is episcopal, the whole of England (including for this
purpose Wales) being divided into two provinces, Canterbury
and York, and 37 bishoprics (including the primatial sees of
Canterbury and York). These again are subdivided into 14,080
parishes (1901), the smallest ecclesiastical units, which are
grouped for certain administrative purposes into 810 rural
deaneries. The sovereign is by law the supreme governor of
the church, both in things spiritual and temporal, and he has
the right to nominate to vacant sees. In the case of sees of old
foundation this is done by means of the congé d&rsquo;élire (<i>q.v.</i>), in
that of others by letters patent.<a name="fa15a" id="fa15a" href="#ft15a"><span class="sp">15</span></a> The bishops hold their
temporalities as baronies, for which they do homage in the
ancient form, and are spiritual peers of parliament. Only 26,
however, have the right to seats in the House of Lords, of whom
five&mdash;viz. the two archbishops and the bishops of London,
Durham and Winchester&mdash;always sit, the others taking their
seats in order of seniority of consecration. Under the bishops
the affairs of the dioceses are managed by archdeacons (<i>q.v.</i>)
and rural deans (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Archpriest</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dean</a></span>). The cathedral
churches are governed by chapters consisting of a dean, canons
and prebendaries (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cathedral</a></span>). The deaneries are in the
gift of the crown, canonries and prebends sometimes in that of
the crown, sometimes in that of the bishops. The parish clergy,
with a few rare exceptions (when they are elected by the ratepayers),
are appointed by patronage. The right of presentation
to some 8500 benefices or &ldquo;livings&rdquo; is in the hands of private
persons; the right is regarded in law as property and is, under
certain restrictions for the avoidance of gross simony, saleable
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Advowson</a></span>). The patronage of the remaining benefices
belongs in the main to the crown, the bishops and cathedral
chapters, the lord chancellor, and the universities of Oxford
and Cambridge.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the Church of England is collectively
one of the wealthiest in Christendom, a large proportion of the
&ldquo;livings&rdquo; are extremely poor. To understand this and other
anomalies it is necessary to bear in mind that the church is not,
like the established Protestant churches of Germany, an elaborately
organized state department, nor is it a single corporation
with power to regulate its internal polity. It is a conglomeration
of corporations. Even the incumbent of a parish is in law a
&ldquo;corporation sole,&rdquo; his benefice a freehold; and until the
establishment in 1836, by act of parliament, of the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners (<i>q.v.</i>) nothing could be done to adjust the inequalities
in the emoluments of the clergy resulting from the
natural rise and fall of the value of property in various parts of the
country. Even more extraordinary is the effect of the singular
constitution of the church on its discipline. An incumbent, once
inducted, can only be disturbed by complicated and extremely
costly processes of law; in effect, except in cases of gross
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id="page421"></a>421</span>
misconduct, he is only checked&mdash;so far as ecclesiastical order is
concerned&mdash;by his oath of canonical obedience to the &ldquo;godly&rdquo; monitions
of his bishop; and, since these monitions are difficult and costly to
enforce, while their &ldquo;godliness&rdquo; may be a matter of opinion, an
incumbent is practically himself the interpreter of the law as applied
to the doctrine and ritual of his particular church. The result has been
the development within the Established Church of a most startling
diversity of doctrine and ritual practice, varying from what closely
resembles that of the Church of Rome to the broadest Liberalism and the
extremest evangelical Protestantism. This broad comprehensiveness, which
to outsiders looks like ecclesiastical anarchy, is the characteristic
note of the Church of England; it may be, and has been, defended as
consonant with Christian charity and suited to the genius of a people
not remarkable for logical consistency; but it makes it all the more
difficult to say what the religion of Englishmen actually is, even
within the English Church.</p>

<p>The number of &ldquo;denominations&rdquo; by whom buildings were certified for
worship up to 1895 was 293 (see list in <i>Whitaker&rsquo;s Almanack</i>, 1886, p.
252), but in many instances such &ldquo;denominations&rdquo; consisted of two or
<span class="sidenote">Other Protestant communions.</span>
three congregations only, in some cases of a single congregation. The
more important nonconformist churches are fully dealt with under their
several headings. The above table, however, based on that in the
<i>Statesman&rsquo;s Year-Book</i> for 1908, and giving the comparative statistics
of the chief nonconformist churches, may be useful for purposes of
comparison. It may be prefaced by stating that, according to returns
made in 1905, the Church of England provided sitting accommodation in
parish and other churches for 7,177,144 people; had an estimated number
of 2,053,455 communicants, 206,873 Sunday-school teachers, and 2,538,240
Sunday scholars. There were 14,029 incumbents (rectors, vicars, and
perpetual curates), 7500 curates, <i>i.e.</i> assistant clergy, and some 4000
clergy on the non-active list.</p>

<p>Besides the bodies enumerated in the table there are other churches
concerning which similar statistics are lacking, but which, in several
cases, have large numbers of adherents. The Unitarians are an important
body with (1908) 350 ministers and 345 places of worship. Most numerous,
probably, are the adherents of the Salvation Army, which with a
semi-military organization has in Great Britain alone over 60,000
officers, and &ldquo;barracks,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> preaching stations, in almost every town.
The Brethren, generally known, from their place of origin, as the
Plymouth Brethren, have &ldquo;rooms&rdquo; and adherents throughout England; the
Catholic Apostolic Church (&ldquo;Irvingites&rdquo;) have some 80 churches; the New
Jerusalem Church (Swedenborgians) had (1908) 75 &ldquo;societies&rdquo;; the
Christian Scientists, the Christadelphians, the British Israelites and
similar societies, such as the New and Latter House of Israel, the
Seventh Day Baptists, deserve mention. The Latter Day Saints (Mormons)
had (1908) 82 churches in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Roman Catholicism in England has shown a tendency to advance, especially
among the upper and upper-middle classes. The published lists of
&ldquo;converts&rdquo; are, however, no safe index to actual progress; for no
<span class="sidenote">Roman Catholics.</span>
equivalent statistics are available for &ldquo;leakage&rdquo; in the opposite
direction. The membership of the Roman Catholic Church in England is
estimated at about 2,200,000. But though the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>422</span>
growth of the church relatively to the population has not been
particularly startling, there can be no doubt that, since the
restoration of the Roman Catholic hierarchy in 1851, its general
political and religious influence has enormously increased. A
notable feature in this has been the great development of monastic
institutions, due in large measure to the settlement in England of
the congregations expelled from France. The Roman Catholic
Church in England is organized in 15 dioceses, which are united
in a single province under the primacy of the archbishop of
Westminster. In December 1907 there were 1736 Roman
Catholic churches and stations, and the number of the clergy was
returned at 3524 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Roman Catholic Church</a></span>).</p>

<p class="pt2">The Jews in Great Britain, chiefly found in London and other
great towns, number (1907) about 196,000 and have
<span class="sidenote">Jews.</span>
some 200 synagogues; at the head of their organization
is a chief Rabbi resident in London.</p>

<p>Finally it may be mentioned that a small number of Englishmen,
chiefly resident in Liverpool and London, have embraced
Islam; they have a mosque at Liverpool. Various foreign
churches which have numbers of adherents settled in England
have also branch churches and organizations in the country,
notably the Orthodox Eastern Church,&mdash;with a considerable
number of adherents in London, Liverpool and Manchester,&mdash;the
Lutheran, and the Armenian churches.</p>

<p><i>Roads.</i>&mdash;In England and Wales the high-roads, or roads on
which wheeled vehicles can travel, are of two classes: (1) the
main roads, or great arteries along which the main vehicular
traffic of the country passes; and (2) ordinary highways, which
are by-roads serving only local areas. The length of the main
roads is about 22,000 m., and that of ordinary highways about
96,000. The highways of England, the old coaching roads, are
among the best in the world, being generally of a beautiful
smoothness and well maintained; they vary, naturally, in
different districts, but in many even the local roads are superior
to some main roads in other countries. The supersession of the
stage coach by the railway took a vast amount of traffic away
from the main roads, but their proper maintenance did not
materially suffer; and a larger accession of traffic took place
subsequently on the development of the cycle and the motor-vehicle.</p>

<p>The system of road-building by private enterprise, the undertakers
being rewarded by tolls levied from vehicles, persons or
animals using the roads, was established in England in 1663,
when an act of Charles II. authorized the taking of such tolls
at &ldquo;turnpikes&rdquo; in Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire. A century
later, in 1767, the authorization was extended over the whole
kingdom by an act of George III. In its fulness the system
lasted just sixty years, for the first breach in it was made by an
act of George IV., in 1827, by which the chief turnpikes in London
were abolished. Further acts followed in the same direction,
leading to the gradual extinction, by due compensation of the
persons interested, of the old system, the maintenance of the
roads being vested in &ldquo;turnpike trusts and highway boards,&rdquo;
empowered to levy local rates. The last turnpike trust ceased
to exist on the 5th of November 1895, and the final accounts
in connexion with its debt were closed in 1898-1899. Toll-gates
are now met with only at certain bridges, where the right to levy
tolls is statutory or by prescription. By the Local Government
Act of 1888 the duty of maintaining main roads was imposed
on the county councils, but these bodies were enabled to make
arrangements with the respective highway authorities for their
repair. Under the Local Government Act of 1894 the duties
of all the highway authorities were transferred to the rural
district councils on or before the 31st of March 1899.</p>

<p>It was not until the close of the 18th century, when the
period of road-building activity already indicated set in, that
English roads were redeemed from an extraordinarily bad
condition. The roads were until then, as a rule, merely tracks,
deeply worn by ages of traffic into the semblance of ditches,
and, under adverse weather conditions, impassable. Travellers
also had the risk of assault by robbers and highwaymen. As
early as 1285 a law provided for the cutting down of trees and
bushes on either side of highways, so as to deprive lawless men
of cover. Instances of legislation as regards the upkeep of roads
are recorded from time to time after this date, but (to take a
single illustration) even in the middle of the 18th century the
journey from the village, as it was then, of Paddington to London
by stage occupied from 2½ to 3 hours. But from 1784 to 1792
upwards of 300 acts were passed dealing with the construction
of new roads and bridges.</p>

<p><i>Railways.</i>&mdash;The history and development of railways in
England, their birthplace, and in Ireland and Scotland, with
illustrative statistics, are considered under the heading <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">United
Kingdom</a></span>. The following list indicates the year of foundation,
termini, chief offices and geographical sphere of the chief railways
of England and Wales.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="center pt2">1. <i>Railways with Termini in London.</i></p>

<p>(a) <span class="sc">Northern.</span></p>

<p><i>Great Northern</i> (1846).&mdash;Terminus and offices, King&rsquo;s Cross. Main
line&mdash;Peterborough, Grantham, Newark, Doncaster; forming, with
the North-Eastern and North British lines, the &ldquo;East Coast&rdquo; route
to Scotland. Serving also the West Riding of Yorkshire, Lincolnshire,
Nottingham and other towns of the midlands, and Manchester
(by running powers over the Great Central metals). This company
has so extensive a system of running powers over other railways,
and of lines held jointly with other companies, that few of its more
important express trains from London complete their journeys
entirely on the company&rsquo;s own lines.</p>

<p><i>Midland</i> (1844, an amalgamation of the former North Midland,
Midland Counties, Birmingham &amp; Derby, and other lines).&mdash;Terminus,
St Pancras; offices, Derby. Main line&mdash;Bedford, Leicester, Sheffield,
Leeds and Carlisle, affording the &ldquo;Midland&rdquo; route to Scotland.
Serving also Nottingham, Derby, and the principal towns of the
midlands and West Riding, and Manchester. West and North line
from Bristol, Gloucester and Birmingham to Leicester and Derby.
Also an Irish section, the Belfast and Northern Counties system
being acquired in 1903. Docks at Heysham, Lancashire; and
steamship services to Belfast, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>London &amp; North-Western</i> (1846, an amalgamation of the London
&amp; Birmingham, Grand Junction, and Manchester &amp; Birmingham
lines).&mdash;Terminus and offices, Euston. Main line&mdash;Rugby, Crewe,
Warrington, Preston, Carlisle; forming, with the Caledonian
system, the &ldquo;West Coast&rdquo; route to Scotland. Serves also Manchester,
Liverpool and all parts of the north-west, North Wales,
Birmingham and the neighbouring midland towns, and by joint-lines,
the South Welsh coal-fields. Maintains docks at Garston on
the Mersey, a steamship traffic with Dublin and Greenore from
Holyhead, and, jointly with the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Company,
a service to Belfast, &amp;c., from Fleetwood.</p>

<p><i>Great Central</i> (1846; until 1897, when an extension to London
was undertaken, called the Manchester, Sheffield &amp; Lincolnshire).&mdash;Terminus,
Marylebone; offices, Manchester. Main line&mdash;Rugby,
Nottingham, Leicester, Sheffield, Manchester. The former main
line runs from Manchester and Sheffield east to Retford, thence
serving Grimsby and Hull, with branches to Lincoln, &amp;c. The main
line reached from London by joining the line of the Metropolitan
railway near Aylesbury and following it to Harrow. Subsequently
an alternative route out of London was constructed between Neasden
and Northolt, where it joins another line, of the Great Western
railway, from Acton, and continues as a line held jointly by the
two companies through Beaconsfield and High Wycombe. Here it
absorbs the old Great Western line as far as Prince&rsquo;s Risborough,
and continues thence to Grendon Underwood, effecting a junction
with the original main line of the Great Central system. This line
was opened for passenger traffic in April 1906. The Great Central
company owns docks at Grimsby.</p>

<p class="pt1">(b) <span class="sc">Eastern.</span></p>

<p><i>Great Eastern</i> (1862).&mdash;Terminus and offices, Liverpool Street.
Serving Essex, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk. Joint-line with
Great Northern from March to Lincoln and Doncaster. Passenger
steamship services from Harwich to the Hook of Holland, Antwerp,
Rotterdam, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>London, Tilbury &amp; Southend</i> (1852).&mdash;Terminus and offices,
Fenchurch Street. Serving places on the Essex shore of the Thames
estuary, terminating at Shoeburyness.</p>

<p class="pt1">(c) <span class="sc">Western.</span></p>

<p><i>Great Western</i> (1835, London to Bristol).&mdash;Terminus and offices,
Paddington. Main line&mdash;Reading, Didcot, Swindon, Bath, Bristol,
Taunton, Exeter, Plymouth, Penzance. Numerous additional main
lines&mdash;Reading to Newbury, Weymouth and the west, a new line
opened in 1906 between Castle Cary and Langport effecting a great
reduction in mileage between London and Exeter and places beyond;
Didcot, Oxford, Birmingham, Shrewsbury, Chester with connexions
northward, and to North Wales; Oxford to Worcester, and Swindon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>423</span>
to Gloucester and the west of England; South Welsh system
(through route from London via Wootton Bassett or via Bristol,
and the Severn tunnel), Newport, Cardiff, Swansea, Milford. Steamship
services to the Channel Islands from Weymouth to Waterford,
Ireland from Milford, and to Rosslare, Ireland, from Fishguard,
the route last named being opened in 1906. The line constructed
jointly with the Great Central company (as detailed in the description
above) was extended in 1910 from Ashendon to Aynho, to form a
short route to the great centres north of Oxford.</p>

<p><i>London &amp; South-Western</i> (1839, incorporating the London &amp;
Southampton railway of 1835).&mdash;Terminus and offices, Waterloo.
Main line&mdash;Woking, Basingstoke, Salisbury, Yeovil, Exeter, Plymouth;
Woking, Guildford and Portsmouth; Basingstoke, Winchester,
Southampton, Bournemouth, &amp;c. Extensive connexions
in Surrey, Hampshire and the south-west, as far as North Cornwall.
This company owns the great docks at Southampton, and maintains
passenger services from that port to the Channel Islands, Havre, St
Malo and Cherbourg.</p>

<p class="pt1">(d) <span class="sc">Southern.</span></p>

<p><i>London, Brighton &amp; South Coast</i> (1846).&mdash;Termini, Victoria and
London Bridge. Serving all the coast stations from Hastings to
Portsmouth, with various lines in eastern Surrey and in Sussex.
Maintains a service of passenger steamers between Newhaven and
Dieppe.</p>

<p><i>South Eastern &amp; Chatham</i> (under a managing committee, 1899,
of the South-Eastern company, 1836, and the London, Chatham &amp;
Dover company, 1853).&mdash;Termini&mdash;Victoria, Charing Cross, Holborn
Viaduct, Cannon Street. Offices, London Bridge Station. Various
lines chiefly in Kent. Steamship services between Folkestone and
Boulogne, Dover and Calais, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center pt2">2. <i>Provincial Railways.</i></p>

<p>The two most important railway companies not possessing lines
to London are the North-Eastern and the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire.</p>

<p><i>North Eastern</i> (1854, amalgamating a number of systems).&mdash;Offices,
York. Main line&mdash;Leeds, Normanton and York to Darlington,
Durham, Newcastle and Berwick-on-Tweed. Connecting with
the Great Northern between Doncaster and York, and with the
North British at Berwick, it forms part of the &ldquo;East Coast&rdquo; route
to Scotland. Serving all ports and coast stations from Hull to
Berwick, also Carlisle, &amp;c. Owning extensive docks at Hull, Middlesbrough,
South Shields, the Hartlepools, Blyth, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire</i> (1847, an amalgamation of a number of
local systems).&mdash;Offices, Manchester. Main line&mdash;Manchester, Rochdale,
Tormorden, Wakefield and Normanton, with branches to
Halifax, Bradford, Leeds, Huddersfield and other centres of the West
Riding. Extensive system in south Lancashire, connecting Manchester
with Preston and Fleetwood (where the docks and steamship
services to Ireland are worked jointly with the London &amp; Northwestern
company), Southport, Liverpool, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Among further provincial systems there should be mentioned:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cambrian.</i>&mdash;Offices, Oswestry. Whitchurch, Oswestry, Welshpool
to Barmouth and Pwllheli, Aberystwyth, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Cheshire Lines</i>, worked by a committee representative of the
Great Central, Great Northern and Midland Companies, and affording
important connexions between the lines of these systems and south
Lancashire and Cheshire (Godley, Stockport, Warrington, Liverpool;
Manchester and Liverpool; Manchester and Liverpool to Southport;
Godley and Manchester to Northwich and Chester, &amp;c.).</p>

<p><i>Furness.</i>&mdash;Offices, Barrow-in-Furness. Carnforth, Barrow, Whitehaven,
with branches to Coniston, Windermere (Lakeside), &amp;c.
Docks at Barrow.</p>

<p><i>North Staffordshire.</i>&mdash;Offices, Stoke-upon-Trent. Crewe and the
Potteries, Macclesfield, &amp;c., to Uttoxeter and Derby.</p>

<p><i>Cross-Country Connexions.</i>&mdash;While London is naturally the
principal focal point of the English railway system, the development
of through connexions between the chief lines by way of the
metropolis is very small. Some through trains are provided between
the North-Western and the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast lines
via Willesden Junction, Addison Road and Clapham Junction;
and a through connexion by way of Ludgate Hill has been arranged
between main line trains of the South-Western and the Great Northern
railways, but otherwise passengers travelling through London have
generally to make their own way from one terminus to another.
Certain cross-country routes, however, are provided to connect the
systems of some of the companies, among which the following may
be noticed.</p>

<p>(1) Through connexions with the continental services from
Harwich, and with Yarmouth and other towns of the East coast, are
provided from Yorkshire, Lancashire, &amp;c., by way of the Great
Northern and Great Eastern Joint line from Doncaster and Lincoln
to March.</p>

<p>(2) Through connexions between the systems of the South-Eastern
&amp; Chatham and the Great Western companies are provided via
Reading.</p>

<p>(3) Through connexions between the systems of the Great Central
and the Great Western companies are provided by the line connecting
Woodford and Banbury.</p>

<p>(4) Through connexions between the Midland and the South-Western
systems are provided (a) by the Midland and South-Western
Junction line connecting Cheltenham on the north-and-west line
of the Midland with Andover Junction on the South-Western line;
and (b) by the Somerset &amp; Dorset line, connecting the same lines
between Bath, Templecombe and Bournemouth.</p>

<p>(5) The line from Shrewsbury to Craven Arms and Hereford,
giving connexion between the north and the south-west, and Wales,
is worked by the North-Western and Great Western companies.</p>

<p><i>Inland Navigation.</i>&mdash;The English system of inland navigation is
confined principally to the following districts: South Lancashire,
the West Riding of Yorkshire, the Midlands, especially
about Birmingham, the Fen district and the Thames
<span class="sidenote">Canals and rivers.</span>
basin (especially the lower part). All these districts are
interconnected. The condition of inland navigation, as a whole,
is not satisfactory. The Fossdyke in Lincolnshire, connecting
the river Trent at Torksey with the Witham near Lincoln, and
now belonging to the Great Northern and Great Eastern joint railways,
is usually indicated as the earliest extant canal in England,
inasmuch as it was constructed by the Romans for the purpose
of drainage or water-supply, and must have been used for navigation
at an early period. But the history of canal-building in England is
usually dated from about 1760, and from the construction, at the
instance of Francis, Duke of Bridgewater, of the Bridgewater canal
in South Lancashire, now belonging to the Manchester Ship Canal
Company. The activity in canal-building which prevailed during
the later years of the 18th century was, in a measure, an earlier
counterpart of the first period of railway development, which,
proceeding subsequently along systematized lines not applied to
canal-construction, and providing obvious advantages in respect of
speed, caused railways to withdraw much traffic from canals. Some
canals and river navigations have consequently become derelict,
or are only maintained with difficulty and in imperfect condition.
The inland navigation system suffers from a want of uniformity
in the size of locks, depth of water, width of channels and other
arrangements, so that direct intercommunication between one canal
and another is often impossible in consequence; moreover, although
the canals, like railways, are owned by many separate bodies,
hardly any provision has been made, as it has in the case of railways,
for such facilities as the working of through traffic over various
systems at an inclusive charge. Lastly, the railway companies
themselves have acquired control of about 30% of the total mileage
of canals in England and Wales, and in many cases this has had a
prejudicial effect on the prosperity of canals. Notwithstanding
these disabilities, there has been in modern times a new development
in the trade of some canals, born of a realization that for certain
classes of goods water-transport is cheaper than the swifter rail-transport.
Various proposals have been made for the establishment
of a single control over all inland waterways.</p>

<p>The lower or estuarine courses of some of the English rivers as the
Thames, Tyne, Humber, Mersey and Bristol Avon, are among the
most important waterways in the world, as giving access for seaborne
traffic to great ports. From the Mersey the Manchester Ship
Canal runs to Manchester. The manufacturing districts of South
Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire are traversed and
connected by several canals following transverse valleys of the
Pennine Chain. The main line of the Aire and Calder navigation
runs from Goole by Castleford to Leeds, whence the Leeds and
Liverpool canal, running by Burnley and Blackburn, completes
the connexion between the Humber and the Mersey. Other canals
are numerous, among which may be mentioned the Sheffield and
South Yorkshire, connecting Sheffield with the Trent. The Trent
itself affords an extensive navigation, from which, at Derwent
mouth, the Trent and Mersey Canal runs near Burton and Stafford,
and through the Potteries, to the Bridgewater Canal and so to the
Mersey. This canal is owned by the North Staffordshire railway
company. The river Weaver, a tributary of the Mersey, affords a
waterway of importance to the salt-producing towns of Cheshire.
The system of the Shropshire Union railways and canal company,
which is connected by lease with the London &amp; North-Western
railway company, carries considerable traffic, especially in the
neighbourhood of Ellesmere Port. In the Black Country and
neighbourhood the numerous ramifications of the Birmingham
Canal navigations bear a large mineral traffic. This system is
connected with the rivers Severn and Trent and the canal system
of the country at large, and is controlled by the London &amp; North-Western
company. The principal line of navigation from the
Thames northward to the midlands is that of the Grand Junction,
which runs from Brentford, is connected through London with the
port of London by the Regent&rsquo;s Canal, and follows closely the main
line of the North-Western railway. It connects with the Oxford
Canal at Braunston in Northamptonshire, and through this with
canals to Birmingham and the midlands, and continues to Leicester.
Both the Severn up to Stourport and the Thames up to Oxford have
a fair traffic, but the Thames and Severn Canal is not much used.
There is some traffic on the navigable drainage cuts and rivers of the
Fens, but beyond these, in a broad consideration of the waterways
of England from the point of view of their commercial importance,
it is unnecessary to go.</p>

<p><i>Oversea Communications.</i>&mdash;The chief ports for continental passenger
traffic are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harwich</i> to Amsterdam, Antwerp, Hamburg, Hook of Holland,
Rotterdam (Great Eastern railway); to Copenhagen and Esbjerg
(Royal Danish mail route).</p>

<p><i>Queenborough</i> to Flushing; (Zeeland Steamship company).</p>

(Belgian Royal mail steamers).</p>

<p><i>Folkestone</i> to Boulogne (South Eastern &amp; Chatham railway).</p>

<p><i>Newhaven</i> to Dieppe (London, Brighton &amp; South Coast railway).</p>

<p><i>Southampton</i> to Cherbourg, Havre, St Malo (South-Western
railway).</p>

<p>The chief ports for trans-Atlantic traffic are Liverpool and Southampton,
and special trains are worked in connexion with the steamers
to and from London. The great development of harbour accommodation
at Dover early in the 20th century brought trans-Atlantic
traffic to this port also. Southampton and Liverpool are the two
greatest English ports for all oceanic passenger traffic; but London
has also a large traffic, both to European and to foreign ports.
The passenger traffic to the Norwegian ports, always very heavy in
summer, is carried on chiefly from Hull and Newcastle.</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">VIII. Industries</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;In the agricultural returns for Great Britain,
issued annually by the government, the area of England (apart
from Wales) has been divided into two sections, &ldquo;arable&rdquo; and
&ldquo;grass,&rdquo; corresponding with a former division into &ldquo;corn
counties&rdquo; and &ldquo;grazing counties,&rdquo; except that Leicestershire
is included not in the &ldquo;grass&rdquo; but in the &ldquo;arable&rdquo; section.
Most of the eastern part of England is &ldquo;arable,&rdquo; while the
western and northern part is &ldquo;grass,&rdquo; the boundary between
the sections being the western limit of Hampshire, Berkshire,
Oxfordshire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire,
and of the East Riding of Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The average area under cultivation of all the counties is about
.76 of the whole area. The counties having the greatest area under
cultivation (ranging up to about nine-tenths of the whole) may be
taken to be&mdash;Leicestershire, the East Riding of Yorkshire, Lincolnshire,
Huntingdonshire, Rutland, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire
and Cambridgeshire. Those with the smallest proportional cultivated
area are Westmorland, Middlesex, Northumberland, Surrey, Cumberland,
the North and West Ridings of Yorkshire, Lancashire, Durham
and Cornwall. Geographical considerations govern these conditions
to a very great extent; thus the counties first indicated lie almost
entirely within the area of the low-lying and fertile Eastern Plain,
while the smallest areas of cultivation are found in the counties
covering the Pennine hill-system, with its high-lying uncultivated
moors. In the case of Cornwall and Cumberland the physical
conditions are similar to these; but in that of Middlesex and Surrey
the existence of large urban areas belonging or adjacent to London
must be taken into account. These also affect the proportion of
cultivated areas in the other home counties. The presence of a widespread
urban population must also be remembered in the case of
Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The geographical distribution of the principal crops, &amp;c., may
now be followed. The grain crops grown in England consist almost
exclusively of wheat, barley and oats. Lincolnshire,
Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire and the East
<span class="sidenote">Distribution of crops.</span>
Riding of Yorkshire are especially productive in all
these; the North and West Ridings of Yorkshire produce
a notable quantity of barley and oats; and the oat-crops in
the following counties deserve mention&mdash;Devonshire, Hampshire,
Lancashire, Cumberland, Cornwall, Cheshire and Sussex. There is
no county, however, in which the single crop of wheat or barley
stands pre-eminently above others, and in the case of the upland
counties of Cumberland, Westmorland and Derbyshire, the metropolitan
county of Middlesex, and Monmouthshire, these crops are
quite insignificant. In proportion to their area, the counties specially
productive of wheat are Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Hertfordshire,
Bedfordshire and Essex; and of barley, Norfolk, Suffolk and
the East Riding of Yorkshire. In fruit-growing, Kent takes the
first place, but a good quantity is grown in Cambridgeshire, Norfolk
and Essex, in Worcestershire and other western counties, where,
as in Herefordshire, Somerset and Devon, the apple is especially
cultivated and cider is largely produced. Kent is again pre-eminent
in the growth of hops; indeed this practice and that of fruit-growing
give the scenery of the county a strongly individual character.
Hop-growing extends from Kent into the neighbouring parts of
Sussex and Surrey, where, however, it is much less important; it
is also practised to a considerable degree in a group of counties of
the midlands and west&mdash;Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire
and Shropshire. Market-gardening is carried on most extensively
on suitable lands in the neighbourhood of the great areas of
urban population; thus the open land remaining in Middlesex is
largely devoted to this industry. From the Channel and Scilly
Islands, vegetables, especially seasonable vegetables, and also flowers
which, owing to the peculiar climatic conditions of these islands,
come early to perfection, are imported to the London market.
Considering the crops not hitherto specified, it may be indicated
that turnips and swedes form the chief green crops in most districts;
potatoes, mangels, beans and peas are also commonly grown,
Beyond the three chief grain crops, only a little rye is grown. The
cultivation of flax is almost extinct, but it is practised in a few
districts, such as the East and West Ridings of Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The counties in which the greatest proportion of the land is
devoted to permanent pasture may be judged roughly from the list
of &ldquo;grass counties&rdquo; already given. Derbyshire, Leicestershire,
the midland counties generally, and Somersetshire,
<span class="sidenote">Live stock.</span>
have the highest proportion, and the counties of the East Anglian
seaboard the lowest. But with lands thus classified heath, moor and
hill pastures are not included; and the greatest areas of these are
naturally found in the counties of the Pennines and the Lake District,
especially in Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland and the
North and West Ridings of Yorkshire. There is also plenty of hill-pasture
in the south-western counties (from Hampshire and Berkshire
westward), especially in Devonshire, Cornwall and Somersetshire,
and also in Monmouthshire and along the Welsh marches, on the
Cotteswold Hills, &amp;c. In all these localities sheep are extensively
reared, especially in Northumberland, but on the other hand in
Lincolnshire the numbers of sheep are roughly equal to those in the
northern county. Other counties in which the numbers are especially
large are Devonshire, Kent, Cumberland and the North and West
Ridings of Yorkshire. Cattle are reared in great numbers in Lincolnshire,
Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire, Devonshire,
Somersetshire and Cornwall; but the numbers of both cattle and
sheep are in no English county (save Middlesex) to be regarded as
insignificant. Pigs are bred most extensively in Suffolk, Norfolk
and Lincolnshire and in Somersetshire.</p>

<p>It is often asserted that the scenery of rural England is of its kind
unrivalled. Except in open lands like the Fens, the peculiarly rich
appearance of the country is due to the closely-divided
fields with their high, luxuriant hedges, and especially
<span class="sidenote">Woodlands.</span>
to the profuse growth of trees. There is not, however,
any large continuous forested tract. Certain areas still bear the
name of forest where there is now none; the term here possesses an
historical significance, in many cases indicating former royal game-preserves.
Great areas of England were once under forest. The
clearing of land for agricultural purposes, the use of wood for the
prosecution of the industries of an increasing population, and other
causes, have led to the gradual disforesting of large tracts. There are
still, however, some small well-defined woodland areas. The New
Forest in Hampshire, the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, and
Epping Forest, which is preserved as a public recreation-ground by
the City of London, are the most notable instances. The counties
comprising the greatest proportional amount of woodland fall into
two distinct groups&mdash;Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent, with
Berkshire and Buckinghamshire; Monmouth, Herefordshire and
Gloucestershire. Cambridgeshire, lying almost wholly within the
area of the Fens, has the smallest proportional area of woodland of
any English county.</p>

<p>The number of persons engaged in agriculture in England and
Wales was found by the census of 1901 to be 1,192,167; the total
showing a steady decrease (<i>e.g.</i> from 1,352,389 in 1881), which is
especially marked in the case of females. But the decrease lies
mainly in the number of agricultural labourers; the number of
farmers is not notably affected, and the increasing substitution of
machinery for manual labour must be taken into consideration.
The average size of holdings in England may be taken approximately
as 66 acres, the average in 1903 being 66.1, whereas in 1895 it
was 65.3.</p>

<p>(See also the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Agriculture</a></span>.)</p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Fisheries.</i>&mdash;All the seas round Britain are rich in fish, and there are
important fishing stations at intervals on all the English coasts,
but those on the east coast are by far the most numerous.
On an estimate of weight and value of the fish landed,
<span class="sidenote">Sea fisheries.</span>
Grimsby at the mouth of the Humber in Lincolnshire,
stands pre-eminent as a fishing port. For example, the fish landed
there in 1903 were of nearly four times the value of those landed at
Hull, which was the second in order of all the English stations.
Next in importance stand Lowestoft, Yarmouth and North Shields,
Boston and Scarborough, and, among a large number of minor
fishing stations, Hartlepool and Ramsgate. Great quantities of fish
are also landed at the riverside market of Billingsgate in London,
but the conditions here are exceptional, the landings being effected
by carrier steamers, plying from certain of the fishing fleets, and not
taking part in the actual process of fishing. On the south coast
Newlyn ranks in the same category with Boston; at Plymouth
considerable catches are landed; and Brixham ranks alongside the
last ports named on the east coast. The chief fishing centres of the
English Channel are thus seen to belong to the coast of Devonshire
and Cornwall. On the west coast the Welsh port of Milford takes
the first place, while Swansea and Cardiff have a considerable fishing
industry, surpassed, however, by that of Fleetwood in Lancashire.
Liverpool also ranks among the more important centres. As a comparison
of the production of the east, south and west coast fisheries,
an average may be taken of the annual catches recorded over a
term of years. In the ten years 1894-1903 this average was 6,985,588
cwt. for the east coast stations, 669,759 cwt. for those of the
south coast, and 884,932 for those of the west (including the Welsh
stations).</p>

<p>Distinctions may be drawn, as will be seen, between the nature
and methods of the fisheries on the various coasts, and the relative
prosperity of the industry from year to year cannot be
considered as a whole. Thus in the period considered the recorded
maximum weight of fish landed at the east coast ports was
9,539,114 cwt. in 1903 (the value being returned as £5,721,105);
whereas on the south coast it was 736,599 cwt. in 1899, and
on the west 1,117,164 cwt. in 1898. Considered as a whole, the
individual fish, by far the most important in the English fisheries,
is the herring, for which Yarmouth and Lowestoft are the chief
ports. The next in order are haddock, cod and plaice, and the east
coast fisheries return the greatest bulk of these also. But whereas
the south coast has the advantage over the west in the herring and
plaice fisheries, the reverse is the case in the haddock and cod
fisheries, haddock, in particular, being landed in very small quantities
at the south coast ports. Mackerel, however, are landed principally
at the southern ports, and the pilchard is taken almost solely off
the south-western coast. A fish of special importance to the west
coast fisheries is the hake. Among shell-fish, crabs and oysters are
taken principally off the east coast; the oyster beds in the shallow
water off the north Kent and Essex coasts, as at Whitstable and
Colchester, being famous. Lobsters are landed in greatest number
on the south coast.</p>

<p>The number of vessels of every sort employed in fishing was
returned in 1903 as 9721, and the number of persons employed as
41,539, of whom 34,071 were regular fishermen. The development
of the steam trawling-vessel is illustrated by the increase in numbers
of these vessels from 480 in 1893 to 1135 in 1903. They belong
chiefly to North Shields, Hull, Grimsby, Yarmouth and Lowestoft.
There are a considerable number on the west coast, but very few
on the south. These vessels have a wide range of operations, pursuing
their work as far as the Faeroe Islands and Iceland on the
one hand, and the Bay of Biscay and the Portuguese coast on the
other.</p>

<p>The English freshwater fisheries are not of great commercial
importance, nor, from the point of view of sport, are the salmon
and trout fisheries as a whole of equal importance with
those of Scotland, Ireland or Wales. The English salmon
<span class="sidenote">Freshwater fisheries.</span>
and trout fisheries may be geographically classified thus:
(1) <i>North-western division</i>, Rivers Eden, Derwent, Lune,
Ribble: (2)<i>North-eastern</i>, Coquet, Tyne, Wear, Tees, &amp;c.; (3)
<i>Western</i>, Dee, Usk, Wye, Severn; (4) <i>South-western</i>, Taw, Torridge,
Camel, Tamar, Dart, Exe, Teign, &amp;c.; (5) <i>Southern</i>, Avon and Stour
(Christchurch) and the Itchin and other famous trout streams of
Hampshire. The rivers of the midlands and east are of little importance
to salmon-fishers, though the Trent carries a few, and in
modern times attempts have been made to rehabilitate the Thames
as a salmon river. The trout-fishing in the upper Thames and
many of its tributaries (such as the Kennet, Colne and Lea) is famous.
But many of the midland, eastern and south-eastern rivers, the
Norfolk Broads, &amp;c., are noted for their coarse fish.</p>

<p><i>Mining.</i>&mdash;Although the conditions of mining have, naturally,
undergone a revolutionary development in comparatively modern
times, yet some indications of England&rsquo;s mineral wealth are found
at various periods of early history. The exploitation of tin in the
south-west is commonly referred back to the time of the Phoenician
sea-traders, and in the first half of the 13th century England supplied
Europe with this metal. At a later period tin and lead were regarded
as the English minerals of highest commercial value; whereas to-day
both, but especially lead, have fallen far from this position. The
Roman working of lead and iron has been clearly traced in many
districts, as has that of salt in Cheshire. The subsequent development
of the iron industry is full of interest, as, while extending
vastly, it has entirely lapsed in certain districts. However long
before it may have been known to a few, the use of coal for smelting
iron did not become general till the later part of the 18th century,
and down to that time, iron-working was confined to districts where
timber was available for the supply of the smelting medium, charcoal.
Thus the industry centred chiefly upon the Weald (Sussex
and Kent), the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, and the Birmingham
district; but from the first district named it afterwards wholly
departed, following the development of the coal-fields. These have,
in some cases, a record from a fairly early date; thus, an indication
of the Northumberland coal-supply occurs in a charter of 1234, and
the Yorkshire coal-field is first mentioned early in the following
century. But how little this source of wealth was developed appears
from an estimate of the total production of coal, which gives in
1700 only 2,612,000 tons, and, in 1800, 10,080,000 tons, against
the returned total (for the United Kingdom) of 225,181,300 tons
in 1900.</p>

<p>The chief minerals raised in England, as stated in the annual
home office report on mines and quarries, appear in order of value,
thus: coal, iron ore, clay and shale, sandstone, limestone, igneous
rocks, salt, tin ore. Coal surpasses all the other minerals to such an
extent that, taking the year 1903 as a type, when the total value of
the mineral output was very nearly £70,000,000, that of coal is
found to approach £61,000,000.</p>

<p>The position of the various principal coal-fields has been indicated
in dealing with the physical geography of England, but the grouping
of the fields adopted in the official report may be given
<span class="sidenote">Coal-fields.</span>
here, together with an indication of the counties covered
by each, and the percentage of coal to the total bulk
raised in each county. These figures are furnished as a general
demonstration of the geographical distribution of the industry,
but are based on the returns for 1903.</p>

<p>The coal-fields on the eastern flank of the Pennines, therefore,
namely, the Northern and the Yorkshire, are seen to be by far the
most important in England. The carrying trade in coal is naturally
very extensive, and may be considered here. The principal ports
for the shipping of coal for export, set down in order of the amount
shipped, also fall very nearly into topographical groups, thus:&mdash;Newcastle,
South Shields and Blyth in the Northern District;
Newport in Monmouthshire; Sunderland in the Northern District,
Hull, Grimsby and Goole on the Humber, which forms the eastern
outlet of the Yorkshire coal-fields; Hartlepool, in the Northern
District, and Liverpool. The tonnage annually shipped ranges
from about 4½ millions of tons in the case of Newcastle to some half
a million in the case of Liverpool; but the export trade of Cardiff
in South Wales far surpasses that of any English port, being more
than three times that of Newcastle in 1903. The coastwise carrying
trade is also important, the bulk being shared about equally by
Sunderland, Newcastle, South Shields and Cardiff, while Liverpool
has also a large share. Of the whole amount of coal received coastwise
at English and Welsh ports (about 13½ million tons), London
received considerably over one-half (nearly 8 million tons in 1903).
The railways having the heaviest coal traffic are the North-Eastern,
which monopolizes the traffic of Northumberland and Durham;
the Midland, commanding the Derbyshire, Yorkshire and East
Midland traffic, and some of the Welsh; the London &amp; North
Western, whose principal sources are the Lancashire, Staffordshire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>426</span>
and South Welsh districts; the Great Western and the Taff Vale
(South Welsh), with the Great Central, Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire and
Great Northern systems.</p>

<p>In the face of railway competition, several of the canals maintain
a fair traffic in coal, for which they are eminently suitable&mdash;the
system of the Birmingham navigation, the Aire and Calder navigation
of Yorkshire, and the Leeds and Liverpool navigation have the largest
shares in this trade.</p>

<p>The richest iron-mining district in England and in the United
Kingdom is the Cleveland district of the North Riding of Yorkshire.
It produces over two-fifths of the total amount of ore
raised in the Kingdom, and not much less than one-half
<span class="sidenote">Iron.</span>
of that raised in England. The richness of the ore (about 30% of
metal) is by no means so great as the red haematite ore found in
Cumberland and north Lancashire (Furness district, &amp;c.). Here the
percentage is over 50, but the ore, though the richest found in the
kingdom, is less plentiful, about 1½ million tons being raised in 1903
as against more than 5½ millions in Cleveland. There is also a considerable
working of brown iron ore at various points in Lincolnshire,
Northamptonshire and Leicestershire; with further workings of
less importance in Staffordshire and several other districts. The
total amount of ore raised in England is about 12½ million tons,
but it is not so high, in some iron-fields, as formerly. Some of the
lesser deposits have been worked out, and even in the rich Furness
fields it has been found difficult to pursue the ore. The import of
ore (the bulk coming from Spain) has consequently increased, and the
ports where the principal import trade is carried on are those which
form the principal outlets of the iron-working districts of Cleveland
and Furness, namely Middlesbrough and Barrow-in-Furness.</p>

<p>The geographical distribution of the remaining more important
English minerals may be passed in quicker review. Of the metals,
the production of copper is a lapsing industry, confined to Cornwall.
For the production of lead the principal counties are Derbyshire,
Durham and Stanhope, but the industry is not extensive, and is
confined to a few places in each county. Quarrying for limestone,
clay and sandstone is general in most parts. For limestone the
principal localities are in Durham, Derbyshire and Yorkshire, while
for chalk-quarrying Kent is pre-eminent among a group of south-eastern
counties, including Hampshire, Sussex and Surrey, with
Essex. Fireclay is largely raised from coal-mines, while, among
special clays, there is a considerable production of china and potter&rsquo;s
clays in Cornwall, Devonshire and Dorsetshire. As regards igneous
rocks, the Charnwood Forest quarries of Leicestershire, and those of
Cornwall, are particularly noted for their granite. Slate is worked
in Cornwall and Devon, and also in Lancashire and Cumberland,
where, in the Lake District, there are several large quarries. Salt,
obtained principally from brine but also as rock-salt, is an important
object of industry in Cheshire, the output from that county and
Staffordshire exceeding a million tons annually. In Worcestershire,
Durham and Yorkshire salt is also produced from brine.</p>

<p>The total number of persons in any way occupied in connexion
with mines and quarries in England and Wales in 1901 was 805,185;
the number being found to increase rapidly, as from 528,474 in 1881.
Coal-mines alone occupied 643,654, and to development in this
direction the total increase is chiefly due. The number of ironstone
and other mines decreased in the period noticed from 55,907 to
31,606.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Manufacturing Industries.</i>&mdash;There are of course a great number
of important industries which have a general distribution
throughout the country, being more or less fully developed here
or there in accordance with the requirements of each locality.
But in specifying the principal industries of any county, it is
natural to consider those which have an influence more than
local on its prosperity. In England, then, two broad classes
of industry may be taken up for primary consideration&mdash;the
textile and the metal. Long after textile and other industries
had been flourishing in the leading states of the continent, in
the Netherlands, Flanders and France, England remained, as a
whole, an agricultural and pastoral country, content to export
her riches in wool, and to import them again, greatly enhanced
in value, as clothing. It is not to be understood that there
were no manufacturing industries whatever. Rough cloth, for
example, was manufactured for home consumption. But from
Norman times the introduction of foreign artisans, capable of
establishing industries which should produce goods fit for
distant sale, occupied the attention of successive rulers. Thus
the plantation of Flemish weavers in East Anglia, especially
at the towns of Worstead (to which is attributed the derivation
of the term worsted) and Norwich, dates from the 12th century.
The industry, changing locality, like many others, in sympathy
with the changes in modern conditions, has long been practically
extinct in this district. Then, when religious persecution drove
many of the industrial population of the west of Europe away
from the homes of their birth, they liberally repaid English
hospitality by establishing their own arts in the country, and
teaching them to the inhabitants. Thus religious liberty formed
part of the foundation of England&rsquo;s industrial greatness. Then
came the material agent, machinery propelled by steam. The
invention of the steam engine, following quickly upon that of
the carding machine, the spinning jenny, and other ingenious
machinery employed in textile manufactures, gave an extraordinary
impulse to their development, and, with them, that
of kindred branches of industry. At the basis of all of them
was England&rsquo;s wealth in coal. The vast development of industries
in England during the 19th century may be further
correlated with certain events in the general history of the time.
Insular England was not affected by the disturbing influences
of the Napoleonic period in any such degree as was continental
Europe. Such conditions carried on the work of British inventors
in helping to develop industries so strongly that manufacturers
were able to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by
the American Civil War (in spite of the temporary disability it
entailed upon the cotton industry) and by the Franco-German
War. These wars tended to paralyse industries in the countries
affected, which were thus forced to English markets to buy
manufactured commodities. That England, not possessing the
raw material, became the seat of the cotton manufacture, was
owing to the ingenuity of her inventors. It was not till the later
part of the 18th century, when a series of inventions, unparalleled
in the annals of industry, followed each other in quick succession,
that the cotton manufacture took real root in the country,
gradually eclipsing that of other European nations, although
a linen manufacture in Lancashire had acquired some prominence
as early as the 16th century. But though the superior excellence
of their machinery enabled Englishmen to start in the race of
competition, it was the discovery of the new motive power,
drawn from coal, which made them win the race. In 1815 the
total quantity of raw cotton imported into the United Kingdom
was not more than 99 millions of pounds, which amount had
increased to 152 millions of pounds in 1820, and rose further
to 229 millions in 1825, so that there was considerably more than
a doubling of the imports in ten years.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The geographical analysis of the cotton industry in England is
simple. It belongs almost entirely to south Lancashire&mdash;to Manchester
and the great industrial towns in its neighbourhood.
The industry has extended into the adjacent parts of
<span class="sidenote">Textiles.</span>
Cheshire, the West Riding of Yorkshire and Derbyshire. The
immediate neighbourhood of a coal-supply influenced the geographical
settlement of this industry, like others; and the importance
to the manufacture of a moist climate, such as is found on the western
slope of the Pennines (in contradistinction to the eastern), must also
be considered. The excess of the demand of the factories over the
supply of raw material has become a remarkable feature of the
industry in modern times.</p>

<p>The distribution of the woollen industries peculiarly illustrates
the changes which have taken place since the early establishment
of manufacturing industries in England. It has been seen how
completely the industry has forsaken East Anglia. Similarly, this
industry was of early importance along the line of the Cotteswold
Hills, from Chipping Camden to Stroud and beyond, as also in some
towns of Devonshire and Cornwall, but though it survives in the
neighbourhood of Stroud, the importance of this district is far
surpassed by that of the West Riding of Yorkshire, where the woollen
industry stands pre-eminent among the many which, as already
indicated, have concentrated there. As the cotton industry has
in some degree extended from Lancashire into the West Riding, so
has the woollen from the West Riding into a few Lancastrian towns,
such as Rochdale. Among other textile industries attaching to
definite localities may be mentioned the silk manufacture of eastern
Staffordshire and Cheshire, as at Congleton and Macclesfield; and
the hosiery and lace manufactures of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire
and Leicestershire.</p>

<p>The metal-working industries also follow a geographical distribution,
mainly governed by the incidence of the coal-fields, as well
as by that of the chief districts for the production of
iron-ore already indicated, such as the Cleveland and
<span class="sidenote">Metal-working.</span>
Durham and the Furness districts. But the district most
intimately connected with every branch of this industry, from
engineering and the manufacture of tools, &amp;c., to working in the
precious metals, is the &ldquo;Black Country&rdquo; and Birmingham district
of Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire. Apart from this
district, large quantities of iron and steel are produced in the manufacturing
areas of Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>427</span>
and here, as in the Black Country, are found certain centres
especially noted for the production of an individual class of goods,
such as Sheffield for its cutlery. There is, further, a large engineering
industry in the London district; and important manufactures of
agricultural implements are found at many towns of East Anglia
and in other agricultural localities. Birmingham and Coventry
may be specially mentioned as centres of the motor and cycle
building industry. The establishment of their engineering and other
workshops at certain centres by the great railway companies has
important bearing on the concentration of urban population. For
example, by this means the London &amp; North Western and the
Great Western companies have created large towns in Crewe and
Swindon respectively.</p>

<p>Certain other important industries may be localized. Thus, the
manufacture of china and pottery, although widespread, is primarily
identified with Staffordshire, where an area comprising Stoke and a
number of contiguous towns actually bears the name of the Potteries
(<i>q.v.</i>). Derby has a similar fame, while the manufacture of glass,
important in Leeds and elsewhere in the West Riding of Yorkshire,
and in the London district, centres peculiarly upon a single town in
South Lancashire&mdash;St Helens. Finally, the bootmakers of Northamptonshire
(at Wellingborough, Rushden, &amp;c.), and the straw-plaiters
of Bedfordshire (at Luton and Dunstable), deserve mention
among localized industrial communities.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Occupations of the People.</i>&mdash;The occupations of the people
may be so considered as to afford a conception of the relative
extent of the industries already noticed, and their importance
in relation to other occupations. The figures to be given are
those of the census of 1901, and embrace males and females
of 10 years of age and upwards. The textile manufactures
occupied a total of 994,668 persons, of which the cotton industry
occupied 529,131. A high proportion of female labour is characteristic
of each branch of this industry, the number of females
employed being about half as many again as that of males
(the proportion was 1.47 to 1 in 1901). The metal industries
of every sort occupied 1,116,202; out of which those employed
in engineering (including the building of all sorts of vehicles)
numbered 741,346. Of the other broad classes of industry
already indicated, the manufacture of boots and shoes occupied
229,257, and the pottery and glass manufactures 90,193. For
the rest, the numbers of persons occupied in agriculture has been
quoted as 1,192,167; and of those occupied in mining as 805,185.
Among occupations not already detailed, those of the male
population include transport of every sort (1,094,301), building
and other works of construction (1,042,864), manufacture of
articles of human consumption, lodging, &amp;c. (774,291), commerce,
banking, &amp;c. (530,685), domestic service, &amp;c. (304,195), professional
occupations (311,618). The service of government in
every branch occupied 171,687. Female workers were occupied
to the number of 1,664,381 in domestic service generally. Tailoring
and the textile clothing industries and trade generally
occupied 602,881; teaching 172,873; nursing and other work
in institutions 104,036; and the civil service, clerkships and
similar occupations 82,635.</p>

<p class="center pt2">IX. <span class="sc">Territorial Divisions, &amp;c.</span></p>

<p>For various administrative and other purposes England and
Wales have been divided, at different times from the Saxon
period onwards, into a series of divisions, whose boundaries have
been adjusted as each purpose demanded, without much attempt
to establish uniformity. Therefore, although the methods of
local government are detailed below (Section X.), and other
administrative arrangements are described under the various
headings dealing with each subject, it is desirable to give here, for
ease of reference and distinction, a schedule of the various areas
into which England and Wales are divided. The areas here given,
excepting the Poor Law Union, are those utilized in the Census
Returns (see the General Report, 1901).</p>

<p>The ancient counties were superseded for most practical
purposes by the administrative counties created by the Local
Government Act of 1888. The ancient division, however,
besides being maintained in general speech and usage, forms
the basis on which the system of distribution of parliamentary
representation now in force was constructed. The Redistribution
of Seats Act 1885 made a new division of the country into
county and borough constituencies. All the English counties,
with the exception of Rutland, are divided into two or more
constituencies, each returning one member, the number of
English county parliamentary areas being 234. In Wales eight
smaller or less populous counties form each one parliamentary
constituency, while the four larger are divided, the number of
Welsh county parliamentary areas being 19. The number of
county areas for parliamentary purposes in England and Wales is
thus 253, and the total number of their representatives is the
same. Outside the county constituencies are the parliamentary
boroughs. Of these there are 135 in England, one of them,
Monmouth district, being made up of three contributory boroughs,
while many are divided into several constituencies, the number of
borough parliamentary areas in England being 205, of which 61
are in the metropolis. Of the 205 borough constituencies, 184
return each one member, and 21 return each two members, so
that the total number of English borough members is 226.
Besides the county and borough members there are in England
five university members, namely, two for Oxford, two for
Cambridge and one for London. In Wales there are 10 borough
parliamentary areas, all of which, except Merthyr Tydfil and
Swansea town division, consist of groups of several contributory
boroughs. Each Welsh borough constituency returns one
member, except Merthyr Tydfil, which returns two, so that there
are eleven Welsh borough members.</p>

<p>The administrative counties, created in 1888, number 62, each
having a county council. They sometimes coincide in area with
the ancient counties of the same name, but generally differ, in a
greater or less degree, for the following reasons&mdash;(1) in some
cases an ancient county comprises (approximately) two or more
administrative counties, in the formation of which names of
some ancient divisions were preserved, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Scilly Islands, which form part of the ancient county of
Cornwall, without being ranked as an administrative county,
are provided with a county council and have separate administration.
(2) The administrative county of London has an area
taken entirely from the counties of Middlesex, Kent and Surrey.
(3) All boroughs which on June 1, 1888, had a population of not
less than 50,000, boroughs which were already counties having
a population of not less than 20,000, and a few others, were formed
into separate administrative areas, with the name of county
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>428</span>
boroughs. Of these there were originally 61, but their number
subsequently increased. (4) Provision was made by the act of
1888 for including entirely within one administrative county
each of such urban districts as were situated in more than one
ancient county.</p>

<p>The various urban and rural districts are described below
(Section X.). The <i>Civil Parish</i> is defined (Poor Law Amendment
Act 1866) as &ldquo;a place for which a separate poor-rate is or can be
made,&rdquo; but the parish council has local administrative functions
beyond the administration of the poor law. The civil parish has
become more or less divorced in relationship from the <i>Ecclesiastical
Parish</i> (a division which probably served in early times for
administrative purposes also), owing to successive independent
alterations in the boundaries of both (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Parish</a></span>). <i>Poor-law
unions</i> are groups of parishes for the local administration of the
Poor Laws. Within the unions the local poor-law authorities are
the <i>Board of Guardians</i>. In rural districts the functions of these
boards are, under the Local Government Act of 1894, performed
by the district councils, and in other places their constitution is
similar to that of the urban and district councils (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Poor Law</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Registration districts</i> are generally, but not invariably, coextensive
with unions of the same name. These districts are
divided into sub-districts, within which the births and deaths are
registered by registrars appointed for that purpose. <i>Registration
counties</i> are groups of registration districts, and their boundaries
differ more or less from those both of the ancient and the administrative
counties. In England and Wales there are eleven
registration divisions, consisting of groups of registration counties
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Registration</a></span>).</p>
<div class="author">(O. J. R. H.)</div>

<p class="center pt2 sc">X. Local Government</p>

<p>The Reform Act of 1832 was the real starting-point for the
overhauling of English local government. For centuries before,
from the reign of Edward III., under a number of statutes and
commissions, the administrative work in the counties had been in
the hands of the country gentlemen and the clergy, acting as
justices of the peace, and sitting in petty sessions and quarter
sessions. Each civil or &ldquo;poor law&rdquo; parish was governed by the
vestry and the overseers of the poor, dating from the Poor Law of
1601; the vestry, which dealt with general affairs, being presided
over by the rector, and having the churchwardens as its chief
officials. In 1782 Gilbert&rsquo;s Act introduced the grouping of
parishes for poor law purposes, and boards of guardians appointed
by the justices of the peace. The municipal boroughs (246 in
England and Wales in 1832) were governed by mayor, aldermen,
councillors and a close body of burgesses or freemen, a narrow
oligarchy. Reform began with the Poor Law Amendment Act of
1834, grouping the parishes into Unions, making the boards of
guardians mainly elective, and creating a central poor law board
in London. The Municipal Corporations Act followed in 1835,
giving all ratepayers the local franchise. And as a result of the
failure of the Public Health Board established in 1848, the royal
commission of 1869-1871 led to the establishment in 1871 of the
Local Government Board as a central supervising body. Meanwhile,
the school boards resulting from the Education Act of
1870 brought local government also into the educational system;
and the Public Health Act of 1875 put further duties on the local
authorities. By 1888 a new state of chaos had grown up as the
result of the multiplication of bodies, and the new Redistribution
Act of 1885 paved the way for a further reorganization of local
matters by the Local Government Act of 1888, followed by that of
1894. In London, which required separate treatment, a similar
process had been going on. The Metropolis Management Act of
1855 established (outside the city) two classes of parishes&mdash;the
first class with vestries of their own, the second class grouped
under district boards elected by the component vestries; and the
Metropolitan Board of Works (abolished in 1888), elected by the
vestries and the district boards, was made the central authority.</p>

<p>In 1867 the Metropolitan Asylums Board took over its
work from the metropolitan boards of guardians. See further
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Charity and Charities</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Public Health</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Education</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Justice of the Peace</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vestry</a></span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The system of local government now existing in England (see
also the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Local Government</a></span>) may be said to have been
founded in 1888, when the Local Government Act of that year
was passed. Since then the entire system of the government
of districts and parishes has been reorganized with due regard
to the preceding legislation. The largest area of local government
is the county; next to that the sanitary district, urban
or rural, including under this head municipal boroughs, all of
which are urban districts. The parish is, speaking generally,
the smallest area, though, as will hereafter be seen, part of a
parish may be a separate area for certain purposes; and there
may be united districts or parishes for certain purposes. It will
be convenient to follow this order in the present article. But
before doing so, it should be pointed out that all local bodies
in England are to some extent subject to the control of central
authorities, such as the privy council, the home office, the Board
of Agriculture, the Board of Trade, the Board of Education or
the Local Government Board.</p>

<p><i>The Administrative County.</i>&mdash;The administrative county includes
all places within its area, with two important exceptions.
The first of these consists of the county borough.
The second is the quarter sessions borough, which
<span class="sidenote">The county and the county council.</span>
forms part of the county for certain specified purposes
only. But the county includes all other places, such
as liberties and franchises, which before 1888 were exempt from
contribution to county rate. For each administrative county
a county council is elected. For purposes of election the entire
county is divided into divisions corresponding to the wards
of a municipal borough, and one councillor is elected for each
electoral division.</p>

<p>The electors are the county electors, <i>i.e.</i> in a borough the
persons enrolled as burgesses, and in the rest of the county the
<span class="sidenote">County council elections.</span>
persons who are registered as county electors, <i>i.e.</i>
those persons who possess in a county the same
qualification as burgesses must have in a borough,
and are registered.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The qualification of a burgess or county elector is substantially
the occupation of rated property within the borough or county,
residence during a qualifying period of twelve months within the
borough or county, and payment of rates for the qualifying property.
A person so qualified is entitled to be enrolled as a burgess, or
registered as a county elector (as the case may be), unless he is
alien, has during the qualifying period received union or parochial
relief or other alms, or is disentitled under some act of parliament
such as the Corrupt Practices Act, the Felony Act, &amp;c. The lists
of burgesses and county electors are prepared annually by the
overseers of each parish in the borough or county, and are revised
by the revising barrister at courts holden by him for the purpose in
September or October of each year. When revised they are sent to
the town clerk of the borough, or to the clerk of the peace of the
county, as the case may be, by whom they are printed. The lists
are conclusive of the right to vote at an election, although on election
petition involving a scrutiny the vote of a person disqualified by
law may be struck off, notwithstanding the inclusion of his name
in a list of voters.</p>

<p>The qualification of a county councillor is similar to that required
of a councillor in a municipal borough, with some modifications.
A person may be qualified in any one of the following ways: viz.
by being (1) enrolled as a county elector, and possessed of a property
qualification consisting of the possession of real or personal property
to the amount of £1000 in a county having four or more divisions,
or of £500 in any other county, <i>or</i> the being rated to the poor rate
on an annual value of £30 in a county having four or more divisions,
or of £15 in any other county; (2) enrolled in the non-resident list,
and possessed of the same property qualification (the non-resident
list contains the names of persons who are qualified for enrolment in
all respects save residence in the county or within 7 m. thereof, and
are actually resident beyond the 7 m. and within 15 m.); (3) entitled
to elect to the office of county councillor (for this qualification no
property qualification is required, but the office of a councillor elected
on this qualification only becomes vacant if for six months he ceases
to reside within the county); (4) a peer owning property in the
county; (5) registered as a parliamentary voter in respect of the
ownership of property in the county. Clerks in holy orders and
ministers of religion are not disqualified as they are for being borough
councillors, but in other respects the persons disqualified to be
elected for a county are the same as those disqualified to be elected
for a borough. Such disqualifications include the holding of any
office or place of profit under the council other than the office of
chairman, and the being concerned or interested in any contract or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>429</span>
employment with, by or on behalf of the council. Women, other
than married women, are eligible.</p>

<div class="center pt2"><img style="width:607px; height:850px" src="images/img428a.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="noind f80"><a href="images/img428a1.jpg">(Click to enlarge.)</a></p>

<p class="pt2">County councillors are elected for a term of three years, and at
the end of that time they retire together. The ordinary day of
election is the 8th March, or some day between the 1st and 8th
March fixed by the council. Candidates are nominated in writing
by a nomination paper signed by a proposer and seconder, and
subscribed by eight other assenting county electors of the division;
and in the event of there being more valid nominations than vacancies
a poll has to be taken in the manner prescribed by the Ballot Act
1872. Corrupt and illegal practices at the election are forbidden
by a statute passed in the year 1894, which imposes heavy penalties
and disqualifications for the offences which it creates. These
offences include not only treating, undue influence, bribery and
personation, but certain others, of which the following are the chief.
Payment on account of the conveyance of electors to or from the
poll; payment for any committee room in excess of a prescribed
number; the incurring of expenses in and about the election beyond
a certain maximum; employing, for the conveyance of electors
to or from the poll, hackney carriages or carriages kept for hire;
payments for bands, flags, cockades, &amp;c.; employing for payment
persons at the election beyond the prescribed number; printing and
publishing bills, placards or posters which do not disclose the name
and address of the printer or publisher; using as committee rooms or
for meetings any licensed premises, or any premises where food or
drink is ordinarily sold for consumption on the premises, or any club
premises where intoxicating liquor is supplied to members. In the
event of an illegal practice, payment, employment or hiring, committed
or done inadvertently, relief may be given by the High Court,
or by an election court, if the validity of the election is questioned
on petition; but unless such relief is given (and it will be observed
that it cannot be given for a <i>corrupt</i> as distinguished from an illegal
practice), an infringement of the act may void the election altogether.
The validity of the election may be questioned by election petition.
Indeed, this is the only method when it is sought to set aside the
election on any of the usual grounds, such as corrupt or illegal
practices, or the disqualification of the candidate at the date of
election. Election petitions against county councillors and members
of other local bodies (borough councillors, urban and rural district
councillors, members of school boards and boards of guardians) are
classed together as municipal election petitions, and are heard in the
same way, by a commissioner who must be a barrister of not less
than fifteen years&rsquo; standing. The petition is tried in open court at
some place within the county, the expenses of the court being provided
in the first instance by the Treasury, and repaid out of the
county rates, except in so far as the court may order them to be paid
by either of the parties. If a candidate is unseated a casual vacancy
is created which has to be filled by a new election. A county
councillor is required to accept office by making and subscribing a
declaration in the prescribed form that he will duly and faithfully
perform the duties of the office, and that he possesses the necessary
qualification. The declaration may be made at any time within
three months after notice of election. If the councillor does not
make it within that time, he is liable to a fine the amount of which,
if not determined by bye-law of the council, is £25 in the case of an
alderman or councillor, and £50 in the case of the chairman. Exemption
may, however, be claimed on the ground of age, physical or
mental incapacity, previous service, or payment of the fine within
five years, or on the ground that the claimant was nominated without
his consent. If during his term of office a member of the council
becomes bankrupt, or compounds with his creditors, or is (except in
case of illness) continuously absent from the county, being chairman
for more than two months, or being alderman or councillor for more
than six months, his office becomes vacant by declaration of the
council. In the case of disqualification by absence, the same fines
are payable as upon non-acceptance of office, and the same liability
arises on resignation. Acting without making the declaration, or
without being qualified at the time of making the declaration, or
after ceasing to be qualified, or after becoming disqualified, involves
liability to a fine not exceeding £50, recoverable by action.</p>

<p>The councillors who have been elected come into office on the
8th March in the year of election. The first quarterly meeting of
the newly-elected council is held on the 16th or on such
other day within ten days after the 8th as the county
<span class="sidenote">Chairman, &amp;c.</span>
council may fix. The first business at that meeting is
the election of the chairman, whose office corresponds to that of the
mayor in a borough. He is elected for the ensuing year, and holds
office until his successor has accepted office. The chairman must
be a fit person, elected by the council from their own body or from
persons qualified to be councillors. He may receive such remuneration
as the council think reasonable. He is by virtue of his office
a justice of the peace for the county. Having elected the chairman,
the meeting proceeds to the election of aldermen, whose
number is one-third of the number of councillors, except in London,
where the number is one-sixth. An alderman must be a councillor
or a person qualified to be a councillor. If a councillor is elected
he vacates his office of councillor, and thus creates a casual vacancy
in the council. In every third year one-half of the whole number
of aldermen go out of office, and their places are filled by election,
which is conducted by means of voting papers. It will be observed,
therefore, that while a county councillor holds office for three years,
a county alderman holds office for six. The council may also appoint
a vice-chairman who holds office during the term of office of the
chairman; in London the council have power to appoint a paid
deputy chairman.</p>

<p>It may be convenient at this point to refer to the officers of the
county council. Of these, the chief are the clerk, the treasurer,
and the surveyor. Before 1888 the clerk of the peace
was appointed in a county by the <i>custos rotulorum</i>.
<span class="sidenote">Officers.</span>
He held office for life during good conduct, and had power to act by
a sufficient deputy. Under the act of 1888 existing clerks of the
peace became clerks of the councils of their counties, holding office
by the same tenure as formerly, except in the county of London,
where the offices were separated. Thereafter a new appointment to
the offices of clerk of the peace and clerk of the county council
was to be made by the standing joint-committee, at whose pleasure
he is to hold office. The same committee appoint the deputy-clerk,
and fix the salaries of both officers. The clerk of the peace
was formerly paid by fees which were fixed by quarter sessions,
but he is now generally, if not in every case, paid by salary, the fees
received by him being paid into the county fund. The county council
may also employ such other officers and servants as they may think
necessary.</p>

<p>Subject to a few special provisions in the Local Government Act
of 1888, the business of the county council is regulated by the provisions
laid down in the Municipal Corporations Act
1882, with regard to borough councils. There are four
<span class="sidenote">Business.</span>
quarterly meetings in every year, the dates of which may be fixed
by the council, with the exception of that which must be held on
the 16th March or some day within ten days after the 8th of March
as already noticed when treating of elections. Meetings are convened
by notices sent to members stating the time and place of
the meeting and the business to be transacted. The chairman, or
in his absence the vice-chairman, or in the absence of both an
alderman or councillor appointed by the meeting, presides. All
questions are determined by the votes of the majority of those
present and voting, and in case of equality of votes the chairman
has a casting vote. Minutes of the proceedings are taken, and if
signed by the chairman at the same or the next meeting of the
council are evidence of the proceedings. In all other respects the
business of the council is regulated by standing orders which the
council are authorized to make. Very full power is given to appoint
committees, which may be either general or special, and to them
may be delegated, with or without restrictions or conditions, any
of their powers or duties except that of raising money by rate or
loan. Power is also given to appoint joint-committees with other
county councils in matters in which the two councils are jointly
interested, but a joint-committee so appointed must not be confounded
with the standing joint-committee of the county council
and the quarter sessions, which is a distinct statutory body and is
elsewhere referred to. The finance committee is also a body with
distinct duties.</p>
</div>

<p>In order to appreciate some of the points relating to the finance
of a county council, it is necessary to indicate the relations
between an administrative county and the boroughs
which are locally situated within it. The act of 1888
<span class="sidenote">Relation of county to boroughs.</span>
created a new division of boroughs into three classes;
of these the first is the county borough. A certain
number of boroughs which either had a population of not less
than 50,000, or were counties of themselves, were made counties
independent of the county council and free from the payment
of county rate. In such boroughs the borough council have,
in addition to their powers under the Municipal Corporations
Act 1882, all the powers of a county council under the Local
Government Act. They are independent of the county council,
and their only relation is that in some instances they pay a
contribution to the county, <i>e.g.</i> for the cost of assizes where
there is no separate assize for the borough. The boroughs thus
constituted county boroughs enumerated in the schedule to the
Local Government Act 1888 numbered sixty-one, but additional
ones are created from time to time.</p>

<p>The larger quarter sessions boroughs, <i>i.e.</i> those which had,
according to the census of 1881, a population exceeding 10,000,
form part of the county, and are subject to the control of the
county council, but only for certain special purposes. The
reason for this is that while in counties the powers and duties
under various acts were entrusted to the county authority, in
boroughs they were exercised by the borough councils. In the
class of boroughs now under consideration these powers and
duties are retained by the borough council; the county council
exercise no jurisdiction within the borough in respect of them,
and the borough is not rated in respect of them to the county
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>430</span>
rate. The acts referred to include those relating to the diseases
of animals, destructive insects, explosives, fish conservancy,
gas meters, margarine, police, reformatory and industrial schools,
riot (damages), sale of food and drugs, weights and measures.
But for certain purposes these boroughs are part of the county
and rateable to county rate, <i>e.g.</i> main roads, cost of assizes and
sessions, and in certain cases pauper lunatics. The county
councillors elected for one of these boroughs may not vote on
any matter involving expenditure on account of which the
borough is not assessed to county rate.</p>

<p>The third class of boroughs comprises those which have a
separate court of quarter sessions, but had according to the
census of 1881 a population of less than 10,000. All such
boroughs form part of the county for the purposes of pauper
lunatics, analysts, reformatory and industrial schools, fish
conservancy, explosives, and, of course, the purposes for which
the larger quarter sessions boroughs also form part of the county,
such as main roads, and are assessed to county rate accordingly.
And in a borough, whether a quarter sessions borough or not,
which had in 1881 a population of less than 10,000, all the powers
which the borough council formerly possessed as to police,
analysts, diseases of animals, gas meters, and weights and
measures cease and are transferred to the county council, the
boroughs becoming in fact part of the area of the county for
these purposes.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that for some purposes, called in the
act general county purposes, the entire county, including all
boroughs other than county boroughs, is assessed to the county
rate; while for others, called special county purposes, certain
boroughs are now assessed. This explanation is necessary in
order to appreciate what has now to be said about county finance.
But before leaving the consideration of the area of the county
it may be added that all liberties and franchises are now merged
in the county and subject to the jurisdiction of the county
council.</p>

<p>The county council is a body corporate with power to hold
lands. Its revenues are derived from various sources which
will presently be mentioned, but all receipts have to
be carried to the county fund, either to the general
<span class="sidenote">Finance.</span>
county account if applicable to general county purposes, or
to the special county account if applicable to special county
purposes. The county council may, with the consent of the
Local Government Board, borrow money on the security of the
county fund or any of its revenues, for consolidating the debts
of the county; purchasing land or buildings; any permanent
work or other thing, the cost of which ought to be spread over
a term of years; making advances in aid of the emigration or
colonization of inhabitants of the county; and any purpose for
which quarter sessions or the county council are authorized by
any act to borrow. If, however, the total debt of the council
will, with the amount proposed to be borrowed, exceed one-tenth
of the annual rateable value of the property in the county,
the money cannot be borrowed unless under a provisional order
made by the Local Government Board and confirmed by parliament.
The period for which a loan is made is fixed by the county
council with the consent of the Local Government Board, but
may not exceed thirty years, and the mode of repayment may
be by equal yearly or half-yearly instalments of principal or of
principal and interest combined, or by means of a sinking fund
invested and applied in accordance with the Local Government
Acts. The loans authorized may be raised by debentures or
annuity certificates under these acts, or by the issue of county
stock, and in some cases by mortgage.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The county council must appoint a finance committee for regulating
and controlling the finance of the county, and the council
cannot make any order for the payment of money out of the county
fund save on the recommendation of that committee. Moreover,
the order for payment of any sum must be made in pursuance of an
order of the council signed by three members of the finance committee
present at the meeting of the council, and countersigned
by the clerk. The order is directed to the county treasurer, by whom
authorized payments are then made.</p>

<p>The accounts of the receipts and expenditure of the county
council are made up for the twelve months ending the 31st March
in each year, and are audited by a district auditor. The form in
which the accounts must be made up is prescribed by the Local
Government Board. The auditor is a district auditor appointed
by the Local Government Board under the District Auditors Act
1879, and in respect of the audit the council is charged with a
stamp duty, the amount of which depends on the total of the expenditure
comprised in the financial statement. Before each audit
the auditor gives notice of the time and place appointed, and the
council publish the appointment by advertisement. A copy of
the accounts has to be deposited for public inspection for seven
days before the audit. The auditor has the fullest powers of investigation;
he may require the production of any books or papers,
and he may require the attendance before him of any person accountable.
Any owner of property or ratepayer may attend the audit
and object to the accounts, and either on such objection or on his
own motion the auditor may disallow any payment and surcharge
the amount on the persons who made or authorized it. Against
any allowance or surcharge appeal lies to the High Court if the
question involved is one of law, or to the Local Government Board,
who have jurisdiction to remit a surcharge if, in the circumstances,
it appears to them to be fair and equitable to do so. It will be seen
that this is really an effective audit.</p>

<p>The sources of revenue of the council are the exchequer contribution,
income from property and fees, and rates. Before 1888 large
grants of money had been made annually to local
authorities in aid of local taxation. Such grants represented
<span class="sidenote">Revenue of county council.</span>
a contribution out of taxation for the most part
arising out of property other than real property, while
local taxation fell on real property alone. By the act of 1888 it
was provided that for the future such annual grants should cease,
and that other payments should be made instead thereof. The
commissioners of Inland Revenue pay into the Bank of England, to
an account called &ldquo;the local taxation account,&rdquo; the sums ascertained
to be the proceeds of the duties collected by them in each county
on what are called local taxation licences, which include licences
for the sale of intoxicating liquor, licences on dogs, guns, establishment
licences, &amp;c. The amount so ascertained to have been collected
in each county is paid under direction of the Local Government
Board to the council of that county. The commissioners of Inland
Revenue also pay into the same account a sum equal to 1½%
on the net value of personal property in respect of which estate
duty is paid. Under the Local Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act
1890, certain duties imposed on spirits and beer (often referred to as
&ldquo;whisky money&rdquo;) are also to be paid to &ldquo;the local taxation account.&rdquo;
The sums so paid in respect of the duties last above mentioned,
and in respect of the estate duty and spirits and beer additional
duties, are distributed among the several counties in proportion to
the share which the Local Government Board certify to have been
received by each county during the financial year ending the 31st
March 1888, out of the grants theretofore made out of the exchequer
in aid of local rates. The payments so made out of &ldquo;the local
taxation account&rdquo; to a county council are paid to the county fund,
and carried to a separate account called &ldquo;the Exchequer contribution
account.&rdquo; The money standing to the credit of this account is
applied: (i.) in paying any costs incurred in respect thereof or otherwise
chargeable thereon; (ii.) in payment of the sums required by the
Local Government Act 1888 to be paid in substitution for local
grants; (iii.) in payment of the new grant to be made by the county
council in respect of the costs of union officers; and (iv.) in repaying
to &ldquo;the general county account&rdquo; of the county fund the
costs on account of general county purposes for which the whole
area of the county (including boroughs other than county boroughs)
is liable to be assessed to county contribution. Elaborate provision
is made for the distribution of the surplus (if any), with a view to
securing a due share being paid to the quarter sessions boroughs.</p>

<p>The payments which the county council have to make in substitution
for the local grants formerly made out of Imperial funds include
payments for or towards the remuneration of the teachers in poor-law
schools and public vaccinators; school fees paid for children
sent from a workhouse to a public elementary school; half of the
salaries of the medical officer of health and the inspector of nuisances
of district councils; the remuneration of registrars for births and
deaths; the maintenance of pauper lunatics; half of the cost of the
pay and clothing of the police of the county, and of each borough
maintaining a separate police force. In addition to the grants above
mentioned, the county council is required to grant to the guardians
of every poor-law union wholly or partly in their county an annual
sum for the costs of the officers of the union and of district schools to
which the union contributes. Another source is the income of any
property belonging to the council, but the amount of this is usually
small. The third source of revenue consists of the fees received by
the different officers of the county councils or of the joint-committee.
For example, fees received by the clerk of the peace, inspectors of
weights and measures, and the like. These fees are paid into the
county fund, and carried either to &ldquo;the general county account&rdquo; or,
if they have been received in respect of some matter for which part
only of the county is assessed, then to the special account to which
the rates levied for that purpose are carried. The remaining source
of income of a county council is the county rate, the manner of
levying which is hereafter stated.</p>
</div>

<div class="center pt2"><img style="width:850px; height:601px" src="images/img430a.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="noind f80"><a href="images/img430a1.jpg">(Click to enlarge.)</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>431</span></p>

<p class="pt2">Of the powers and duties of county councils, it may be convenient
to treat of these first, in so far as they are transferred
to or conferred on them by the Local Government
Act 1888, under which they were created, and afterwards
<span class="sidenote">Powers transferred from quarter sessions.</span>
in so far as they have been conferred by subsequent
legislation. Before the passing of the Local
Government Act 1888, the only form of county government
in England was that of the justices in quarter
sessions (<i>q.v.</i>). Quarter sessions were originally a judicial body,
but being the only body having jurisdiction over the county as
a whole, certain powers were conferred and certain duties imposed
upon them with reference to various matters of county government
from time to time. The principal object of the act of 1888
was to transfer these powers and duties from the quarter sessions
to the new representative body&mdash;the county council; and it
may be said that substantially the whole of the administrative
business of quarter sessions was thus transferred.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The subjects of such transfer include (i.) the making, assessing
and levying of county, police, hundred and all rates, and the application
and expenditure thereof, and the making of orders for the
payment of sums payable out of any such rate, or out of the county
stock or county fund, and the preparation and revision of the basis
or standard for the county rate. With regard to the county rate,
a few words of description may be sufficient here. The council
appoint a committee called a county rate committee, who from
time to time prepare a basis or standard for county rate, that is to
say, they fix the amount at which each parish in the county shall
contribute its quota to the county rate. As a general rule the poor-law
valuations are followed, but this is not universally the case,
some county councils adopting the assessment to income tax,
schedule A, and others forming an independent valuation of their
own. The overseers of any parish aggrieved by the basis may
appeal against it to quarter sessions, and it is to be noticed that
this appeal is not interfered with, the transfer of the duties of
justices relating only to administrative and not to judicial business.
When a contribution is required from county rate, the county
council assess the amount payable by each parish according to the
basis previously made, and send their precept to the guardians of
the unions comprising the several parishes in the county, the
guardians in their turn requiring the overseers of each parish to
provide the necessary quota of that parish out of the poor rate, and
the sum thus raised goes into the county fund. The police rate is
made for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the county
police. It is made on the same basis as the county rate, and is
levied with it. The hundred rate is seldom made, though in some
counties it may be made for purposes of main roads and bridges
chargeable to the hundred as distinguished from the county at
large; (ii.) the borrowing of money; (iii.) the passing of the accounts
of, and the discharge of the county treasurer; (iv.) shire halls,
county halls, assize courts, the judges&rsquo; lodgings, lock-up houses,
court houses, justices&rsquo; rooms, police stations and county buildings,
works and property; (v.) the licensing under any general act of
houses and other places for music or for dancing, and the granting of
licences under the Racecourses Licensing Act 1879; (vi.) the provision,
enlargement, maintenance and management and visitation of,
and other dealing with, asylums for pauper lunatics; (vii.) the
establishment and maintenance of, and the contribution to, reformatory
and industrial schools; (viii.) bridges and roads repairable with
bridges, and any powers vested by the Highways and Locomotives
Amendment Act 1878 in the county authority. It may be observed
that bridges have always been at common law repairable by the
county, although, with regard to bridges erected since the year 1805,
these are not to be deemed to be county bridges repairable by the
county unless they have been erected under the direction or to the
satisfaction of the county surveyor. The common-law liability to
repair a bridge extends also to the road or approaches for a distance
of 300 ft. on each side of the bridge. Of the powers vested in the
county authority under the Highway Act 1878, the most important
are those relating to main roads, which are specially noticed hereafter;
(ix.) the tables of fees to be taken by and the costs to be allowed
to any inspector, analyst or person holding any office in the county
other than the clerk of the peace and the clerks of the justices;
(x.) the appointment, removal and determination of salaries of the
county treasurer, the county surveyor, the public analysts, any
officer under the Explosives Act 1875, and any officers whose remuneration
is paid out of the county rate, other than the clerk of the
peace and the clerks of the justices; (xi.) the salary of any coroner
whose salary is payable out of the county rate, the fees, allowances
and disbursements allowed to be paid by any such coroner, and the
division of the county into coroners&rsquo; districts and the assignments
of such districts; (xii.) the division of the county into polling
districts for the purposes of parliamentary elections, the appointment
of the places of election, the places of holding courts for the revision
of the lists of voters, and the costs of, and other matters to be done
for the registration of parliamentary voters; (xiii.) the execution as
local authority of the acts relating to contagious diseases of animals,
to destructive insects, to fish conservancy, to wild birds, to weights
and measures, and to gas meters, and of the Local Stamp Act 1869;
(xiv.) any matters arising under the Riot (Damages) Act 1886.
Under this act compensation is payable out of the police rate to
any person whose property has been injured, stolen or destroyed by
rioters; (xv.) the registration of rules of scientific societies, the
registration of charitable gifts, the certifying and recording of places
of religious worship, the confirmation and record of the rules of loan
societies. These duties are imposed under various statutes.</p>

<p>In addition to the business of quarter sessions thus transferred,
there was also transferred to the county council certain business of
the justices of the county out of session, that is to say, in petty or
special sessions. This business consists of the licensing of houses
or places for the public performance of stage plays, and the execution,
as local authority, of the Explosives Act 1875. Power was
given by the act to the Local Government Board to provide, by
means of a provisional order, for transferring to county councils
any of the powers and duties of the various central authorities
which have been already referred to; but although such an order
was at one time prepared, it has never been confirmed, and nothing
has been done in that direction.</p>

<p>Apart from the business thus transferred to county councils, the
act itself has conferred further powers or imposed further duties
with reference to a variety of other matters, some of
which must be noticed. But before passing to them
<span class="sidenote">Police.</span>
it is necessary here to call attention to one important subject of
county government which has not been wholly transferred to the
county council, namely, the police. It was matter of considerable
discussion before the passing of the act whether the police should
remain under the control of the justices, or be transferred wholly
to the control of the county council. Eventually a middle course
was taken. The powers, duties and liabilities of the quarter sessions
and justices out of session with respect to the county police were
vested in the quarter sessions and the county council jointly, and
are now exercised through the standing joint-committee of the
two bodies. That committee consists of an equal number of members
of the county council and of justices appointed by the quarter
sessions, the number being arranged between the two bodies or
fixed by the secretary of state. The committee are also charged
with the duties of appointing or removing the clerk of the peace,
and they have jurisdiction in matters relating to justices&rsquo; clerks,
the provision of accommodation for quarter sessions or justices out
of session, and the like, and their expenses are paid by the county
council out of the county fund. The standing joint-committee
have power to divide their county into police districts, and, when
required by order in council, are obliged to do so. In such a case,
while the general expenditure in respect of the entire police force
is defrayed by the county at large, the local expenditure, <i>i.e.</i> the
cost of pay, clothing and such other expenses as the joint-committee
may direct, is defrayed at the cost of the particular district for
which it is incurred (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Police</a></span>).</p>

<p>Among the powers and duties given to county councils by the
Local Government Act 1888, the first to be mentioned, following
the order in the act itself, is that of the appointment
of county coroners. The duties of a coroner are limited
<span class="sidenote">County coroners.</span>
to the holding of inquiries into cases of death from causes
suspected to be other than natural, and to a few miscellaneous
duties of comparatively rare occurrence, such as the holding of
inquiries relating to treasure trove, and acting instead of the sheriff
on inquiries under the Lands Clauses Act, &amp;c., when that officer is
interested and thereby disabled from holding such inquiries. (For
the history of the office of coroner, which is a very ancient one,
see that title.) The county council may appoint any fit person, not
being a county alderman or county councillor, to fill the office, and
in the case of a county divided into coroners&rsquo; districts, may assign
him a district. It has been decided, however, that the power hereby
conferred does not extend to the appointment of a coroner for a
liberty or other franchise who would not under the old law have
been appointed by the freeholders. It may be mentioned that
though a coroner may have a district assigned to him, he is nevertheless
a coroner for the entire county throughout which he has
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>It was provided by the Highway Act 1878 that every road which
was disturnpiked after the 31st of December 1870 should be deemed
to be a main road, the expenses of the repair and maintenance
of which were to be contributed as to one-half
<span class="sidenote">Main roads.</span>
thereof by the justices in quarter sessions, then the
county authority. By another section of the same act it was
provided that where any highway in a county was a medium of
communication between great towns, or a thoroughfare to a railway
station, or otherwise such that it ought to be declared a main road,
the county authority might declare it to be a main road, and thereupon
one-half the expense of its maintenance would fall upon the
county at large. Once a road became a main road it could only cease
to be such by order of the Local Government Board. As already
stated, the powers of the quarter sessions under the act of 1878
were transferred to the county council under the Local Government
Act of 1888, and that body alone has now power to declare a road
to be a main road. But the act of 1888 made some important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>432</span>
changes in the law relating to the maintenance of main roads. It
declared that thereafter not only the half but the whole cost of
maintenance should be borne by the county. Provision is made
for the control of main roads in urban districts being retained by
the urban district council. In urban districts where such control
has not been claimed, and in rural districts, the county council may
either maintain the main roads themselves or allow or require the
district councils to do so. The county council must in any case
make a payment towards the costs incurred by the district council,
and if any difference arises as to the amount of it, it has to be settled
by the Local Government Board. In Lancashire the cost of main
roads falls upon the hundred, as distinguished from the county at
large, special provision being made to that effect. Special provision
has also been made for the highways in the Isle of Wight and in
South Wales, where the roads were formerly regulated by special
acts, and not by the ordinary Highway Acts.</p>

<p>The county council have the same power as a sanitary authority to
enforce the provisions of the Rivers Pollution Prevention Acts in
relation to so much of any stream as passes through
or by any part of their county. Under these acts a
<span class="sidenote">Rivers pollution prevention.</span>
sanitary authority is authorized to take proceedings to
restrain interference with the due flow of a stream or the
pollution of its waters by throwing into it the solid refuse of any
manufactory or quarry, or any rubbish or cinders, or any other waste
or any putrid solid matter. They may also take proceedings in
respect of the pollution of a stream by any solid or liquid sewage
matter. They have the same powers with respect to manufacturing
and mining pollutions, subject to certain restrictions, one of which is
that proceedings are not to be taken without the consent of the Local
Government Board. The county council may not only themselves
institute proceedings under the acts, but they may contribute to
the costs of any prosecution under the acts instituted by any other
county or district council. The Local Government Board is further
empowered by provisional order to constitute a joint-committee
representing all the administrative counties through or by which a
river passes, and confer on such committee all or any of the powers
of a sanitary authority under the acts.</p>

<p>A county council has the same power of opposing bills in parliament
and of prosecuting or defending any legal proceedings necessary
for the promotion or protection of the interests of the
inhabitants of a county as are conferred on the council
<span class="sidenote">Parliamentary and legal costs.</span>
of a municipal borough by the Borough Funds Act 1872,
with this difference, that in order to enable them to oppose
a bill in parliament at the cost of the county rate, it is not
necessary to obtain the consent of the owners and ratepayers within
the county. The power thus conferred is limited to opposing bills.
The council are not authorized to promote any bill, and although
they frequently do so, they incur the risk that if the bill should not
pass the members of the council will be surcharged personally with
the costs incurred if they attempt to charge them to the county rate.
Of course if the bill passes, it usually contains a clause enabling the
costs of promotion to be paid out of the county rate. It must not be
supposed, however, that the county council have no power to
institute or defend legal proceedings or oppose bills save such as is
expressly conferred upon them by the Local Government Act. In
this respect they are in the same position as all other local authorities,
with respect to whom it has been laid down that they may without
any express power in that behalf use the funds at their disposal for
protecting themselves against any attack made upon their existence
as a corporate body or upon any of their powers or privileges.</p>

<p>The county council have also the same powers as a borough council
of making by-laws for the good government of the county and for
the suppression of nuisances not already punishable
under the general law. This power has been largely
<span class="sidenote">By-laws.</span>
acted upon throughout England, and the courts of law have on
several occasions decided that such by-laws should be benevolently
interpreted, and that in matters which directly arise and concern
the people of the county, who have the right to choose those whom
they think best fitted to represent them, such representatives may
be trusted to understand their own requirements. Such by-laws
will therefore be upheld, unless it is clear that they are uncertain,
repugnant to the general law of the land, or manifestly unreasonable.
It may be mentioned that, while by-laws relating to the good government
of the county have to be confirmed by the secretary of state,
those which relate to the suppression of nuisances have to be confirmed
by the Local Government Board. Such confirmation, however,
though necessary to enable the council to enforce them, does
not itself confer upon them any validity in point of law.</p>

<p>The county council have power to appoint and pay one or more
medical officers of health, who are not to hold any other appointment
or engage in private practice without the express
written consent of the council. The council may make
<span class="sidenote">Medical officers.</span>
arrangements whereby any district council or councils
may have the services of the county medical officer on payment of
a contribution towards his salary, and while such arrangement
is in force the duty of the district council to appoint a medical
officer is to be deemed to have been satisfied. Every medical officer,
whether of a county or district, must now be legally qualified for
the practice of medicine, surgery and midwifery. Besides this, in
the case of a county, or of any district or combination of districts of
which the population exceeds 50,000, the medical officer must also
have a diploma in public health, unless he has during the three
consecutive years before 1892 been medical officer of a district or
combination having a population of more than 20,000, or has before
the passing of the act been for three years a medical officer or inspector
of the Local Government Board.</p>

<p>The only other powers and duties of a county council arising
under the Local Government Act itself which it is necessary to
notice are those relating to alterations of local areas.
It may be convenient here to state that certain alterations
<span class="sidenote">Alterations of local areas.</span>
of areas can only be effected through the medium
of the Local Government Board after local inquiry.
These cases include the alteration of the boundary of any county or
borough, the union of a county borough with a county, the union
of any counties or boroughs or the division of any county, the
making of a borough into a county borough. In these cases the
order of the Local Government Board is provisional only, and must
be confirmed by parliament. The powers of a county council to
make orders for the alteration of local areas are as follows: When
a county council is satisfied that a prima facie case is made out as
respects any county district not a borough, or as respects any
parish, for a proposal for all or any of the things hereafter mentioned,
they may hold a local inquiry after giving such notice in the locality
and to such public departments as may be prescribed from time to
time by the orders of the Local Government Board. The things
referred to include the alteration of the boundary of the district
or parish; the division or union thereof with any other district or
districts, parish or parishes; the conversion of a rural district or part
thereof into an urban district or vice versa. In these cases, after the
local inquiry above referred to has been held, the county council,
being satisfied that the proposal is desirable, may make an order for
the same accordingly. The order has to be submitted to the Local
Government Board, and that board must hold a local inquiry in
order to determine whether the order should be confirmed or not, if
the council of any district affected by it, or one-sixth of the total
number of electors in the district or parish to which it relates, petition
against it. The Local Government Board have power to modify the
terms of the order whether it is petitioned against or not, but if
there is no petition, they are bound to confirm, subject only to such
modifications. Very large powers are conferred upon county councils
for the purpose of giving full effect to orders made by them under
these provisions. A considerable extension of the same powers
was made by the Local Government Act 1894, which practically
required every council to take into consideration the areas of sanitary
districts and parishes within the entire administrative county, and
to see that a parish did not extend into more than one sanitary
district; to provide for the division of a district which did extend
into more than one district into separate parishes, so that for the
future the parish should not be in more than one county district;
and to provide for every parish and rural sanitary district being
within one county. An enormous number of orders under the act of
1894 was made by county councils, and, speaking generally, it will
now be found that no parish extends into more than one county or
county district. Other powers and duties of the county council under
the act of 1894 will be noticed hereafter.</p>
</div>

<p>Of the statutes affecting county councils passed subsequent
to 1888 mention need only be made of the chief.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Previous to the Education Act 1902, county councils had certain
optional powers under the Technical Instruction Acts to supply or
aid the supply of technical or manual instruction. Their
duties in respect to education were, however, much
<span class="sidenote">Education.</span>
enlarged by the act of 1902. That act abolished the old school boards
and school attendance committees, and substituted a single authority
for all kinds of schools and for all kinds of education. The county
council or the council of a county borough is now in every case the
local education authority, except that non-county boroughs with a
population of over 10,000, and urban districts with a population of
over 20,000, may be the local education authorities for elementary
education only, but they may relinquish their powers in favour of the
county council. For higher education county councils and county
boroughs are the sole education authorities, except that non-county
boroughs and urban councils are given a concurrent power of levying
a rate for higher education not exceeding 1d. in the £. Under the
act, an education committee must be established by all authorities.
The majority of the members of the committee are appointed by
the council, usually out of their own body, and the remainder are
appointed by the council on the nomination or recommendation
of other bodies. Some of the members of the committee must be
women. All matters relating to the exercise of the powers of the
education authority (except those of rating and borrowing) must be
referred to the committee, and before exercising any of their powers
the council must (except in cases of emergency) receive and consider
the report of the education committee with respect to the matter in
question. As to higher education the local education authority must
consider the educational needs of their area and take such steps as
seem to them desirable, after consultation with the Board of Education,
to supply or aid the supply of education other than elementary,
and to promote the general co-ordination of all forms of education.
For this purpose they are authorized to levy a rate not exceeding 2d.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433"></a>433</span>
in the £, except with the consent of the Local Government Board.
They must also devote to the same purpose the sums received by
them in respect of the residue of the English share of the local
taxation (customs and excise) duties already referred to. See further
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Education</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Technical Education</a></span>.</p>

<p>Under the Midwives Act 1902, every council of a county or county
borough is the local supervising authority over midwives within its
area. The duty of the local supervising authority is to
exercise general supervision over all midwives practising
<span class="sidenote">Midwives.</span>
within their area in accordance with rules laid down in the act;
to investigate charges of malpractices, negligence or misconduct on
the part of a midwife, and if a prima facie case be established, to
report it to the Central Midwives Board; to suspend a midwife
from practice if necessary to prevent the spread of infection; to
report to the central board the name of any midwife convicted of
an offence; once a year (in January) to supply the central board
with the names and addresses of all midwives practising within
their area and to keep a roll of the names, accessible at all reasonable
times for public inspection; to report at once the death of any
midwife or change in name and address. The local supervising
authority may delegate their powers to a committee appointed by
them, women being eligible to serve on it. A county council may
delegate its powers under the act to a district council.</p>

<p>Part of the business transferred from quarter sessions to the
council was that which related to pauper lunatics, but the whole
subject of lunacy was consolidated by an act of the year
1890, which again has been amended by a later act. The
<span class="sidenote">Lunatics.</span>
councils of all administrative counties and county boroughs and the
councils of a few specified quarter sessions boroughs, which before
1890 were independent areas for purposes of the Lunacy Acts, are
local authorities for the purposes of the Lunacy Acts, and each of
them is under an obligation to provide asylum accommodation for
pauper lunatics. This accommodation may be provided by one
council or by a combination of two or more, and such council or
combination may provide one or more asylums. The county council
exercise their powers through a visiting committee, consisting of not
less than seven members, or, in the case of a combination, of a number
of members appointed by each council in agreed proportions. In
the case of a combination the expenses are defrayed by the several
councils in such proportion as they may agree upon, and the proportion
may be fixed with reference to either the accommodation
required by each council or the population of the district. A county
borough may also, instead of providing an asylum of its own, contract
with the visiting committee of any asylum to receive the pauper
lunatics from the borough. Private patients may be accommodated
in the asylums provided by a county council, and received upon terms
fixed by the visiting committee. The expenses of lunatic asylums
are defrayed in the following manner: The guardians from whose
union a lunatic is sent have to pay a fixed weekly sum, which may
not exceed 14s. a week. A larger charge is made for lunatics received
from unions outside the county, as these do not, of course, contribute
anything towards the provision or up-keep of the asylum itself.
In addition to the payments by guardians, there is a contribution
of 4s. a week from &ldquo;the exchequer contribution account&rdquo; already
mentioned, and the remaining expenses are defrayed out of the
county rate.</p>

<p>Under the Allotments Acts 1887 to 1907, it is the duty of a county
council to ascertain the extent to which there is a demand for
allotments in the urban districts and parishes in the county,
or would be a demand if suitable land were available, and
<span class="sidenote">Allotments.</span>
the extent to which it is reasonably practicable, having
regard to the provisions of the acts, to satisfy any such demand,
and to co-operate with authorities, associations or persons best
qualified to assist, and to take such steps as may be necessary. The
powers of the Local Government Board under the Allotments Acts
were transferred by the act of 1907 to the Board of Agriculture and
Fisheries, and by the same act the powers and duties of rural district
councils were transferred to parish councils. The county council
under these acts has compulsory powers of purchase or hire if they
are unable to acquire land by agreement and on reasonable terms.
If an objection is made to an order for compulsory purchase or hire,
the order will not be confirmed by the Board of Agriculture until
after a local inquiry has been held. If the Board of Agriculture is
satisfied, after holding a local inquiry, that a county council have
failed to fulfil their obligations as to allotments, the board may
transfer all and any of the powers of the county council to the Small
Holdings Commissioners.</p>

<p>By the Small Holdings and Allotments Act 1907, Small Holdings
Commissioners are appointed by the Board of Agriculture to ascertain
the extent of the demand for small holdings, and confer
with county councils as to how best to provide them.
<span class="sidenote">Small holdings.</span>
Local authorities are required to furnish information and
give assistance to the commissioners, who report to the board.
If the board, after considering the report, consider it desirable,
they require the county council concerned to prepare a scheme for
the provision of small holdings; if the county council decline to
prepare a scheme, the board may direct the commissioners to do so.
A county council may also prepare a scheme on its own initiative.
When a scheme has been confirmed, the county council must carry
out the obligations imposed on it within a prescribed time; if they
make default the board may direct the commissioners to assume
all the powers of the county council, and the county council must
repay to the board the expenses the commissioners may incur. A
county council may delegate, by arrangement, to the council of any
borough or urban district in the county their powers in respect of
the act. A small holding is defined by the act as one which exceeds
1 acre, but must not exceed 50 acres or £50 annual value. Every
county council must establish a small holdings and allotments committee,
to which must be referred all matters relating to the exercise
and performance by the council of their powers and duties as to small
holdings and allotments.</p>

<p>Under the Isolation Hospitals Acts 1893 and 1901, a county council
may provide for the establishment of isolation hospitals for the
reception of patients suffering from infectious diseases on
the application of any local authority within the county,
<span class="sidenote">Hospitals.</span>
or on the report of the medical officer of the county that hospital
accommodation is necessary and has not been provided, or it may
take over hospitals already provided by a local authority. The
council by their order constitute a hospital district and form a committee
for its administration. The committee have power to purchase
land, erect a hospital, provide all necessary appliances, and generally
administer a hospital for the purposes above mentioned.</p>

<p>The powers and duties of a county council under the Local Government
Act 1894 are numerous and varied, and the chief of them are
mentioned hereafter in connexion with parish councils.
The county council may establish a parish council in a
<span class="sidenote">Parish councils.</span>
parish which has a population of less than 300, and may
group small parishes under a common parish council; in every case
they fix the number of members of the parish council. They may
authorize the borrowing of money by a parish council, and they may
lend money to a parish council. They may hear complaints by a
parish council that a district council has failed to provide sufficient
sewerage or water-supply, or has failed to enforce the provisions of
the Public Health Acts in their district, and on such complaint they
may transfer to themselves and exercise the powers of the defaulting
council, or they may appoint a person to perform those duties.
They may make orders for the custody and preservation of public
books, writings, papers and documents belonging to a parish. They
may divide a parish into wards for purposes of elections or of parish
meetings. They may authorize district councils to aid persons in
maintaining rights of common. They may, on the petition of a
district council, transfer to themselves the powers of a district council
who have refused or failed to take the necessary proceedings to
assert public rights of way or protect roadside wastes. They may
dispense with the disqualification of a parish or district councillor
arising only by reason of his being a shareholder in a water company
or similar company contracting with the council, and, as has above
been stated, they have large powers of altering the boundaries of
parishes.</p>

<p>Among the powers and duties of quarter sessions transferred to
county councils were those arising under the acts relating
<span class="sidenote">Diseases of animals.</span>
to contagious diseases of animals. These acts were
consolidated and amended by a statute of 1894, and the
county council remain the local authority for the execution of that
act in counties.</p>

<p>Under the Light Railways Act 1896 a county council may be
authorized by order of the light railway commissioners to
<span class="sidenote">Light railways.</span>
construct and work or contract for the construction or
working of a light railway, lend money to a light railway
company, or join any other council in these matters.</p>

<p>Among other statutes conferring powers or imposing duties
upon county councils, mention may be made of such acts as those
relating to sea fisheries regulation, open spaces, police
superannuation, railway and canal traffic, shop hours,
<span class="sidenote">Miscellaneous.</span>
weights and measures, fertilizing and feeding stuffs, wild
birds&rsquo; protection, land transfer, locomotives on highways and the
acquisition of small dwellings. Sufficient has been said to indicate
that the legislature from time to time recognizes the important
position of the county council as an administrative body, and is
continually extending its functions.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Urban District.</i>&mdash;A municipal borough is a place which has
been incorporated by royal charter. In the year 1835 the
Municipal Corporations Act was passed, which made
provision for the constitution and government of
<span class="sidenote">The municipal borough and the borough council.</span>
certain boroughs which were enumerated in a schedule.
That act was from time to time amended, until in 1882
by an act of that year the whole of the earlier acts were
repealed and consolidated. A few ancient corporations
which were not enumerated in the schedule to the act of 1835
continued to exist after that year, but by an act of 1883 all of
these, save such as should obtain charters before 1886, were
abolished, the result being that all boroughs are now subject to
the act of 1882. A place is still created a borough by royal
charter on the petition of the inhabitants, and when that is done
the provisions of the act of 1882 are applied to it by the charter
itself. The charter also fixes the number of councillors, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434"></a>434</span>
boundaries of the wards (if any), and assigns the number of
councillors to each ward, and provides generally for the time and
manner in which the act of 1882 is first to come into operation.
The charter is supplemented by a scheme which makes provision
for the transfer to the new borough council of the powers and
duties of existing authorities, and generally for the bringing into
operation of the act of 1882. If the scheme is opposed by the
prescribed proportion (one-twentieth) of the owners and ratepayers
of the proposed new borough, it has to be confirmed by
parliament. The governing body in a borough is the council
elected by the burgesses.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The qualification of a burgess has been incidentally mentioned
in connexion with that of a county elector, and need not be further
noticed. A borough councillor must be qualified in the same manner
as a county councillor, and he is disqualified in the same way,
with this addition, that a peer or ownership voter is not qualified
as such, and that a person is disqualified for being a borough councillor
if he is in holy orders or is the regular minister of a Dissenting
congregation. Women, other than married women, are eligible.
Borough councillors are elected for a term of three years, one-third
of the whole number going out of office in each year, and if the
borough is divided into wards, these are so arranged that the number
of councillors for each ward shall be three or a multiple of three. The
ordinary day of election is the 1st of November. At an election for
the whole borough the returning officer is the mayor; at a ward
election he is an alderman assigned for that purpose by the council.
The nomination and election of candidates and the procedure at the
election are the same as have already been described in the case of
the election of county councillors. The law as to corrupt and illegal
practices at the election is also similar, and the election may be
questioned by petition in exactly the same way. A borough councillor
must, within five days after notice of his election, make a
declaration of acceptance of office under a penalty, in the case of an
alderman or councillor of £50, and in the case of a mayor of £100, or
such other sums as the council may by by-law determine. A
councillor may be disqualified in the same way as a county councillor,
by bankruptcy or composition with creditors, or continuous absence
from the borough (except in case of illness). In short it may be said
that as the provisions relating to the election of borough councillors
were merely extended to county councillors by the Local Government
Act of 1888 with a few modifications, these provisions, as already
stated when dealing with county councils, apply generally to the
election of borough councillors. After the annual election on the
1st of November the first quarterly meeting of the council is held
on the 9th, and at that meeting the mayor and aldermen are elected.
The election of the mayor and aldermen is again the same as has
already been described in connexion with the election of the chairman
<span class="sidenote">Officers.</span>
and aldermen of a county council. The officers of a
borough council are the town clerk and the treasurer,
but the council have power to appoint such other officers as they
think necessary. All these officers receive such remuneration as the
council from time to time think fit, and hold office during pleasure.
The provisions with respect to the transaction of the business of the
council are also the same in the case of a borough as in that of a
county council.</p>

<p>The entire income of the borough council is paid into the borough
fund, and that fund is charged with certain payments, which are
specifically set out in the 5th schedule to the act of 1882.
These include the remuneration of the mayor, recorder
<span class="sidenote">Finance audit.</span>
and officers of the borough, overseers&rsquo; expenses, the
expenses of the administration of justice in the borough, the payment
of the borough coroner, police expenses and the like. An order of the
council for the payment of money out of the borough fund must be
signed by three members of the council and countersigned by the
town clerk, and any such order may be removed into the king&rsquo;s bench
division of the High Court of Justice by writ of <i>certiorari</i> and may be
wholly or partly disallowed or confirmed on the hearing. This is
really the only way in which the validity of a payment by a borough
council can be questioned, for, as will be seen hereafter, the audit
in the borough is not an effective one. The borough fund is derived,
in the first instance, from the property of the corporation. If the
income from such property is insufficient for the purposes to which it
is applicable, as usually is the case, it has to be supplemented by a
borough rate, which may be a separate rate made by the council
or may be levied through the overseers as part of the poor rate by
means of a precept addressed to them. In the event of the borough
fund being more than sufficient to meet the demands upon it without
recourse to a borough rate, any surplus may be applied in payment
of any expenses of the council as a sanitary authority or in improving
the borough or any part thereof by drainage, enlargement of streets
or otherwise. The borough treasurer is required to make up his
accounts half-yearly, and to submit them, with the necessary
vouchers and papers, to the borough auditors. These auditors are
three in number&mdash;two of them elected annually by the burgesses.
An elective auditor must be qualified to be a councillor, but may not
be a member of the council. The third auditor is appointed by the
mayor and is called the mayor&rsquo;s auditor. The auditors so appointed
are charged with the duty of auditing the accounts of the treasurer,
but they have no power of disallowance or surcharge, and their audit
is therefore quite ineffective.</p>

<p>Where a borough has not a separate court of quarter sessions, but
has a separate commission of the peace, the justices of the county
in which the borough is situate have a concurrent jurisdiction
with the borough justices in all matters arising
<span class="sidenote">Jurisdiction of justices; quarter sessions.</span>
within the borough. Where, however, the borough has
a court of quarter sessions, the county justices have no
jurisdiction within the borough. In all cases, whether
the borough has quarter sessions or a separate commission
or not, the mayor, by virtue of his office, is a justice for the borough,
and continues to be such justice during the year next after he ceases
to be mayor. He takes precedence over all justices in and for the
borough, and is entitled to take the chair at all meetings at which
he is present by virtue of his office of mayor. A separate commission
of the peace may be granted to a borough on the petition of the
council. A borough justice is required to take the oaths of allegiance
and the judicial oaths before acting; he must while acting reside
in or within 7 m. of the borough, or occupy a house, warehouse or
other property in the borough; but he need not be a burgess nor
have the qualification by estate required of a county justice. Where
the borough has a separate commission, the borough justices have
power to appoint a clerk, who is now paid by salary, the fees and
costs pertaining to his office being paid into the borough fund, out
of which his salary is paid. The council may by petition obtain
the appointment of a stipendiary magistrate for the borough. The
crown may also on petition of the council grant a separate court of
quarter sessions for the borough, and in that event a recorder has
to be appointed by the crown. He must be a barrister of not less
than five years&rsquo; standing, and he holds office during good behaviour;
he receives a yearly salary. The recorder sits as sole judge of the
court of quarter sessions of the borough. He has all the powers of
a court of quarter sessions in a county, including the power to hear
appeals from the borough justices; but to this there are a few
exceptions, notably the power to grant licences for the sale of
intoxicating liquor. The grant of a separate court of quarter
sessions also involves the appointment by the council of a clerk of
the peace for the borough. It should be added that the grant of a
court of quarter sessions to any borough other than a county borough
after the passing of the Local Government Act 1888, does not affect
the powers, duties or liabilities of the county council as regards that
borough, nor exempt the parishes in the borough from being assessed
to county rate for any purposes to which such parishes were previously
liable to be assessed.</p>

<p>When a borough is a county of itself the council appoint a sheriff
on the 9th of November in every year. And where the borough has
a separate court of quarter sessions the council appoint
<span class="sidenote">Sheriff, coroner.</span>
a fit and proper person, not an alderman or councillor, to
be the borough coroner, who holds office during good
behaviour. If the borough has a civil court the recorder, if there
is one, is judge of it. If there is no recorder, the judge of the court
is an officer of the borough appointed under the charter.</p>

<p>The provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act 1882 relate
chiefly to the constitution of the municipal corporation. It does
not itself confer many powers or impose many duties
upon the council as a body. It does, however, enable a
<span class="sidenote">Power to acquire land.</span>
municipal corporation to acquire corporate land and
buildings, the buildings including a town hall, council
house, justices&rsquo; room, police stations and cells, sessions house,
judges&rsquo; lodgings, polling stations and the like. The council may
borrow money for the erection of such buildings; they may acquire
and hold land in mortmain by virtue of their charter, or with the
consent of the Local Government Board. Corporate land cannot
be alienated without the consent of the same board. The council
may convert corporate land, with the approval of the Local Government
Board, into sites for workmen&rsquo;s dwellings.</p>

<p>Another duty imposed upon a borough council by the act of
1882 is the maintenance of bridges within the borough which are
not repairable by the county in which the borough is
<span class="sidenote">Borough bridges.</span>
locally situate. It may here be mentioned that a city
or borough which is a county of itself is liable at common
law to repair all public bridges within its limits. In a borough which
is not a county of itself the inhabitants are only liable to repair
bridges within the borough by immemorial usage or custom.</p>

<p>Of the other powers possessed by the council of a borough under
the act of 1882, one of the most important is the power to make
by-laws for the good rule and government of the borough,
and for the prevention and suppression of nuisances not
<span class="sidenote">By-laws.</span>
already punishable in summary manner by virtue of an act in force
throughout the borough. It will be observed that these by-laws are
of two classes. The former do not come into force until the expiration
of forty days after a copy of them has been sent to the secretary of
state, during which forty days the sovereign in council may disallow
any by-law or part thereof. The latter require to be confirmed by the
Local Government Board.</p>

<p>Under the act of 1882 every municipal borough might have its
own separate police force. As has already been stated when dealing
with county councils, boroughs having a population of less than
10,000 according to the census of 1881 can no longer have a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page435" id="page435"></a>435</span>
separate police force. But for some time before that year it had
become the rule not to grant to any new borough with a population
<span class="sidenote">Police.</span>
of less than 20,000 a separate police force. The subject of
police is separately treated in the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>,
and it is not necessary to supplement what is there stated.
Under an act of 1893 the borough police may, in addition to
their ordinary duties, be employed to discharge the duties of a fire
brigade.</p>
</div>

<p>The powers and duties of a borough council in the Municipal
Corporations Act do not arise or exist to any great extent under
that act. In a few cases, those namely of county
boroughs, the councils have the powers of county
<span class="sidenote">The district and the district council.</span>
councils. In the quarter sessions boroughs other than
county boroughs they have some only of these powers.
But in every case the council of the borough have the powers and
duties of an urban district council, and, except where they
derive their authority from local acts, it may be said that their
principal powers and duties consist of those which they exercise or
perform as an urban council. These will now be considered.</p>

<p>Before the year 1848 there was not outside the municipal
boroughs any system of district government in England. It is
true that in some populous places which were not corporate
boroughs local acts of parliament had been passed appointing improvement
commissioners for the government of these places. In
many boroughs similar acts had been obtained conferring various
powers relating to sanitary matters, streets and highways and
the like. But there was no general system, nor was there, save by
special legislation, any means by which sanitary districts could be
constituted. In the year 1848 the first Public Health Act was
passed. It provided for the formation of local boards in boroughs
and populous places, such places outside boroughs being termed
local government districts. In boroughs the town council were
generally appointed the local board for purposes of the act.
It was not, however, until 1872 that a general system of sanitary
districts was adopted. By the Public Health Act of that year the
whole country was mapped out into urban and rural sanitary
districts, and that system has been maintained until the present
time, with some important changes introduced by the Public
Health Acts 1875 to 1907, and the Local Government Act 1894.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The whole of England and Wales is divided into districts, which
are either urban or rural. Urban districts include boroughs and
places which were formerly under the jurisdiction of local
boards or improvement commissioners. The power to
<span class="sidenote">Constitution of district councils.</span>
constitute new urban districts is now conferred upon
county councils, as already stated. There is a concurrent
power in the Local Government Board under the Public
Health Act 1875, but that power is now rarely exercised, and new
urban districts are in practice created only by orders of county
councils made under the Local Government Act 1888, section 57.
Rural districts were first created in 1872. Before that time there
was practically no sanitary authority outside the urban district, for
although the vestry of a parish had in some cases power to make
sewers and had also some other sanitary powers, there was no
authority for such a district as now corresponds to a rural district.
There were, indeed, highway boards and burial boards which had
powers for special purposes, but district authority in the sense in
which it is now understood there was none. Before the year 1894
the rural district consisted of the area of the poor-law union, exclusive
of any urban district which might be within it, and the
guardians of the poor were the rural sanitary authority. Since
1894 this has been changed. By the Local Government Act of
that year the guardians ceased to be the rural sanitary authority.
The union was preserved as the rural sanitary district, with this
qualification, that if it extended into more than one county it was
divided so that no rural district should extend into more than one
county. Rural district councillors are elected for each parish in
the rural district, and they become by virtue of their office guardians
of the poor for the union comprising the district, so that there is
now no election of guardians in a rural district. Guardians are
still elected as such for urban districts, but the rural district council
have ceased to be the same body as the guardians and are now
wholly distinct. A district councillor, whether urban or rural, holds
office for a term of three years. One-third of the whole council
retire in each year, the annual elections being held in March, but
there may be a simultaneous retirement of the whole council in
every third year if the county council at the instance of the district
council so order. The qualification and disqualification of district
councillors, whether urban or rural, now depend upon the Local
Government Act 1894. Property qualification is abolished. Any
person may be elected who is either a parochial elector of some
parish within the district or has during the whole of the twelve
months preceding his election resided in the district, and no person
is disqualified by sex or marriage. The electors both in urban and
rural districts are the body called the parochial electors. These
are practically the persons whose names appear in the parliamentary
register or in the local government register as being entitled to
vote at elections for members of parliament or county or parish
councillors as the case may be. The election takes place subject to
rules made by the Local Government Board, these rules being
largely founded upon adaptations of the Municipal Corporations Act
1882. The election is by ballot on the same lines as those prescribed
for a municipal election, and the Corrupt Practices Act, the provisions
of which have been referred to when dealing with county
councils, applies to the elections of district councils. The provisions
with reference to election petitions, the grounds upon which they
may be presented and the procedure upon them, are the same in
every respect as have already been mentioned when dealing with
county councils. It may be convenient here to state that the Local
<span class="sidenote">United districts.</span>
Government Board has power to unite any number of
districts or parts of districts into what is called a united
district for certain special purposes such as water-supply,
sewerage or the like. This is done by means of a provisional order
made by the board and confirmed by parliament. In such a united
district the governing body is a joint board constituted in manner
provided by the order, and it has under the order such of the powers
of a district council as are necessary for the purposes for which the
united district is created. Thus a joint sewerage board would
generally be invested by the order with all the powers of a district
council relating to the provision and control of sewers and the
disposal of sewage. It may also be convenient here to mention
<span class="sidenote">Port sanitary authority.</span>
another special kind of district authority, that is, a
port sanitary authority. It is also constituted by order
of the Local Government Board, and it may include one
or more sanitary districts or parts of districts abutting
upon a port. In this case also the authority consists of such members
and is elected in such manner as the order determines, and it has
such of the powers of an ordinary district council as the order may
confer upon it. These relate for the most part to nuisances and
infectious disease, having special reference to ships. It has been
thought convenient to deal here with district councils, whether
urban or rural, together, but the powers of the former
<span class="sidenote">Powers of urban and rural councils compared.</span>
are much more extensive than those of the latter, and
as the consideration of the subject proceeds it will be
necessary to indicate what powers and duties are conferred
or imposed upon urban district councils only.
It must be pointed out, however, that when the necessity
arises for conferring upon a rural district council any of the powers
exercisable only by an urban district council, that can be done by
means of an order of the Local Government Board. The necessity
for this provision arises because it sometimes happens that in a
district otherwise rural there are some centres of population, hardly
large enough to be constituted urban districts, which nevertheless
require the same control as an urban district.</p>

<p>A district council may from time to time make regulations with
respect to summoning, notice, place, management and adjournment
of their meetings, and generally with respect to the
transaction and management of their business. Three
<span class="sidenote">Business and offices.</span>
members must be present to constitute a quorum. At the
annual meeting, which is held as soon as convenient after
the 15th April in each year, a chairman for the succeeding year has
to be appointed. He presides at all meetings, and in his absence
another member appointed by the meeting takes his place. Questions
are determined by the majority present and voting, the chairman
having the casting vote. Minutes are taken and, if signed at
the meeting or the next ensuing meeting, are made evidence. The
officers of the council consist of a clerk, a medical officer, a surveyor,
one or more inspectors of nuisances and a treasurer. Of these all but
the medical officer of health and inspectors of nuisances hold office
at pleasure and receive such remuneration as the council may
determine. If the urban district is a borough, the town clerk and
borough treasurer fulfil the same office for purposes of the Public
Health Acts. The salaries of the medical officer of health and
inspectors of nuisances are, as to one moiety thereof, paid out of &ldquo;the
exchequer contribution account&rdquo; by the county council, if they are
appointed in accordance with the requirements of the Local Government
Board as to qualification, appointment, duties, salary and
tenure of office. The orders of the Local Government Board as to
these matters are set out in the <i>Statutory Rules and Orders</i>. District
councils may also employ such other officers and servants as may be
necessary and proper for the fulfilment of their duties. Officers and
servants are prohibited from being concerned or interested in any
bargain or contract made with their council, and from receiving
under cover of their office or employment any fee or reward whatsoever
other than their proper salaries, wages and allowances, under
penalty of being rendered incapable of holding office under any
district council, and of a pecuniary penalty of £50. There are some
exceptions to this provision somewhat similar to those already
mentioned with respect to the disqualification of members of the
council. It may be mentioned here that by an act, called the Public
Bodies&rsquo; Corrupt Practices Act 1889, severe penalties are imposed
alike upon members and officers of public bodies for corruption in
office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436"></a>436</span></p>

<p>A district council may appoint committees consisting wholly or
partly of members of their own body for the exercise of any powers
which in their opinion can properly be exercised by
such committees. Such committees do not, however,
<span class="sidenote">Committees.</span>
hold office beyond the next annual meeting of the council,
and their acts must be submitted to the council for their approval.
If they are appointed for any purposes of the Public Health or
Highway Acts, the council may authorize them to institute any
proceedings or do any act which the council might have instituted
or done, other than the raising of any loan or the making of any rate
or contract. A rural district council may delegate their entire
powers in any parish to a parochial committee. Such committee
may consist wholly of members of their own body or of members of
the parish council, or partly of members of both. Such a committee
may be subject to any regulations and restrictions imposed upon it
by the rural district council.</p>

<p>In dealing with the powers and duties of district councils it will
be convenient to treat of these first as they arise under the Public
Health Acts, and afterwards as they arise under other
statutes. In so far as such powers and duties are common
<span class="sidenote">Public Health Acts.</span>
to urban and rural district councils alike they will be
referred to as appertaining to district councils. When
reference is made to any power or duty of an urban council it is to
be understood that the rural council have no such power or duty
unless conferred or imposed upon them by order of the Local Government
Board. And it must be borne in mind that in a borough the
borough council is the urban district council.</p>

<p>The district council are required to cause to be made such sewers as
may be necessary for effectually draining their district. This duty
may be enforced by the Local Government Board on
complaint made to them that the council have failed in
<span class="sidenote">Sewerage and drainage.</span>
performing it, and in the case of a rural district by the
county council on complaint of the parish council. All
sewers, whether made by the council, by their predecessors, or by
private persons, vest in the district council, that is to say, become
their property, with some exceptions, of which the principal is
sewers made by a person for his own profit. The owner or occupier
of any premises is entitled as of right to cause his drain to be connected
with any sewer, on condition only of his giving notice and
complying with the regulations of the council as to the mode in
which the communication is to be made, and subject to the control
of any person appointed by the council to superintend the work.
Moreover, the owner or occupier of premises without the district
has the same right, subject only to such terms and conditions as
may be agreed or, in ease of dispute, settled by justices or by arbitration.
If a house does not possess a sufficient drain, the occupier
may be required to provide one, and to cause it to discharge into
a sewer if there is one within 100 ft. of the house, otherwise into a
cesspool, as the council may direct. In the case of new houses, these
may not be built or occupied in an urban district without their being
first provided with sufficient drains as the council may require;
and in an urban district it is forbidden to cause any building to be
newly erected over a sewer without the consent of the council. For
the purpose of sewage disposal a district council may construct any
works and contract for the use or purchase or lease of any land,
buildings, engines, materials or apparatus, and contract to supply
for a period not exceeding twenty-five years any person with sewage.
It may be pointed out here that these expressions are defined by the
act, the effect of the definitions being shortly that a drain is a
conduit for the drainage of one building or of several within the same
curtilage, while a sewer comprises every kind of drain except that
which is covered by the definition of a drain as above stated. The
result has been that district councils frequently find themselves in
the position of being responsible for the repair and condition of
drains which, by reason of having been laid for more than one house,
are sewers vested in and repairable by them. An attempt was made
to remedy this state of things by the Public Health Amendment
Act 1890, section 19, but the remedy so provided was very partial,
and may be said to be confined to the case where two or more houses
belonging to different owners are drained into a common drain laid
under private land, and ultimately discharging into a sewer in a road
or street.</p>

<p>The district council are charged with the duty of enforcing the
provision of proper sanitary accommodation (water-closets, privies,
ashpits, &amp;c.) for all dwelling-houses, new or old, and
for factories, and the maintenance of such conveniences
<span class="sidenote">Sanitary accommodation for houses.</span>
in proper condition. The urban council have power to
provide and maintain and make provision for the regulation
of urinals, water-closets, earth-closets, privies,
ashpits and other similar conveniences for public accommodation.
In the event of a complaint being made to a district council that any
drain, closet, privy, ashpit or cesspool is a nuisance or injurious to
health, the council may empower their surveyor to enter and examine
the premises, and, if the complaint is well founded, they may require
the owner to do the necessary works. The district council are not
<span class="sidenote">Removal of refuse.</span>
bound to undertake the removal of house refuse from
premises, or the cleansing of closets, privies, ashpits and
cesspools. They may, however, undertake these duties,
and, if the Local Government Board require, they must do so. An
urban council and a rural council, if invested with the requisite power
by the Local Government Board, may, and when required by order
of that board must, provide for the proper cleansing of streets, and
may also provide for the proper watering of streets. When they have
undertaken, or are required to perform these duties, a penalty is
imposed upon them for neglect. If they do not undertake these
duties, they may make by-laws imposing on the occupiers of premises
the duty of cleansing footways and pavements, the removal of
house refuse, and the cleansing of earth-closets, privies, ashpits
and cesspools; and an urban council may also make by-laws for
the prevention of nuisances arising from snow, filth, dust, ashes
and rubbish, and for the prevention of the keeping of animals on
any premises so as to be injurious to health. The keeping of swine
in a dwelling-house, or so as to be a nuisance, is made an offence
punishable by a penalty in an urban district, as also is the suffering
of any waste or stagnant water to remain in any cellar, or within
any dwelling-house after notice, and the allowing of the contents
of any closet, privy or cesspool to overflow or soak therefrom.
Provision is also made for enforcing the removal of accumulations
of manure, dung, soil or filth from any premises in an urban district,
and for the periodical removal of manure or other refuse from mews,
stables or other premises.</p>

<p>With regard to water-supply, district councils have extensive
powers. They may provide their district or any part of it with a
supply of water proper and sufficient for public and
private purposes, and for this purpose they may construct
<span class="sidenote">Water-supply.</span>
and maintain waterworks, dig wells, take on
lease or hire any waterworks, purchase waterworks or water, or
right to take or convey water either within or without their district,
and any rights, powers and privileges of any water company, and
contract with any person for the supply of water. They may not,
however, commence to construct waterworks within the limits of
supply of any water company empowered by act of parliament or
provisional order to supply water without giving notice to the
company, and not even then so long as the company are able and
willing to supply the necessary water. Any dispute as to whether
the company are able and willing has to be settled by arbitration.
Where the council do supply water, they have the same powers of
carrying mains under streets or through private lands as they have
with respect to the laying of sewers, as already mentioned. They
can charge water rents which depend upon agreements with consumers,
or they may charge water rates assessed on the net annual
value of the premises supplied. It is to be observed that they are
not bound to charge for a supply of water at all, unless they are
required to do so in an urban district by at least ten persons, rated
to the poor rate, or in a parish in a rural district by at least five
persons so rated in the parish. Even then the amount of the rate
is left to the council, any deficiency in the cost of the water, in so
far as it is not defrayed out of water rates or rents, being borne in
an urban district by the general district rate, and in a rural district
by the separate sanitary rates made for the parish or contributory
place supplied. For the purpose of enabling them to supply water,
most of the provisions of the Waterworks Clauses Acts are incorporated
with the Public Health Act, and are made available for the
district council. They are empowered to supply water by measure if
they think fit, and may charge a rent for water-meters. The power
of the district council to supply water is strictly limited to their
own district, but they may, with the sanction of the Local Government
Board, supply water to the council of an adjoining district on
such terms as may be agreed upon, or as, in case of dispute, may be
settled by arbitration. If any house is without a sufficient supply,
and it appears that a supply can be furnished at a reasonable cost,
as defined in the Public Health Act and the Public Health Water
Act 1878, the owner may be required to provide the supply, and,
if he fails, the council may themselves provide the supply and
charge the owner with the cost. All public sources of water-supply
such as streams, pumps, wells, reservoirs, conduits, aqueducts and
works used for the gratuitous supply of water to the inhabitants of
the district are vested in the council, who may cause all such works
to be maintained and plentifully supplied with pure and wholesome
water for the gratuitous use of the inhabitants, but not for sale by
them. The council may supply water to public baths or wash-houses,
or for trade or manufacturing purposes. In the case of the
former the supply may be gratuitous. In the latter case it is to be
on terms agreed between the parties. The urban council are required
to cause fire-plugs, and all necessary works, machinery and assistance
for securing a supply of water in case of fire, to be provided and
maintained, and for this purpose they may enter into an agreement
with any water company or person. Provision is made for preventing
the pollution of water by gas refuse and enabling a district council,
with the sanction of the attorney-general, to take any proceedings
they may think fit for preventing the pollution of any stream in
their district by sewage. The district council are also empowered
to obtain an order of justices directing the closing of any well, tank
or cistern, public or private, or any public pump the water from
which is likely to be used for drinking or domestic purposes, or for
manufacturing drinks for the use of man, if such water is found to be
so polluted as to be injurious to health.</p>

<p>Power is given to prohibit the use as dwellings of any cellars,
vaults or underground rooms built or occupied after 1875, and with
regard to such cellars as were occupied as dwellings before 1875,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page437" id="page437"></a>437</span>
the continued occupation of these is also forbidden unless they
<span class="sidenote">Cellar dwellings.</span>
comply with certain stringent requirements as to the height of
the rooms, height of the ceilings above the surface of
the street, open areas in front, effectual drainage, sanitary
conveniences appurtenant to the cellars, and the provision
of fireplaces.</p>

<p>District councils are required to keep a register of the common
lodging-houses in their district. No person is allowed to keep a
common lodging-house unless he is registered, and a
house may not be registered until it has been inspected
<span class="sidenote">Common lodging-houses.</span>
and approved for the purpose by an officer of the council.
Further, the council may refuse to register a keeper
unless they are satisfied of his character and of his fitness for the
position. The council are empowered to make by-laws for fixing the
number of lodgers and separating the sexes therein, promoting
cleanliness and ventilation, giving of notices and taking precautions
in case of any infectious disease, and generally for the well-ordering
of such houses. The keepers of common lodging-houses are required
to limewash their walls and ceilings in the months of April and
October in every year, and if paupers or vagrants are received to
lodge, they may be required to report as to the persons who have
resorted thereto. They must give notice of any infectious disease
to the medical officer of health and to the poor-law relieving officer,
and they must give free access for inspection. There is no definition
of the expression &ldquo;common lodging-house&rdquo; in the Public Health
Acts, and at one time the courts decided that shelters for the destitute
kept by charitable persons were not common lodging-houses. That
idea is now exploded, and the acts apply to charitable institutions
which receive persons of the class ordinarily received into common
lodging-houses.</p>

<p>By-laws may also be made relating to houses let in lodgings
which are not common lodging-houses. These by-laws
<span class="sidenote">Houses let in lodgings.</span>
are in practice limited to those inhabited by
the poorer classes, although the act imposes no such
restriction.</p>

<p>The Public Health Acts 1875 to 1907 contain elaborate provisions
for dealing with nuisances. Those which are dealt with summarily
are thus enumerated:&mdash;(1) any premises in such a state
as to be a nuisance or injurious to health; (2) any pool,
<span class="sidenote">Nuisances.</span>
ditch, gutter, watercourse, privy, urinal, cesspool, drain or ashpit so
foul or in such a state as to be injurious to health; (3) any animal so
kept as to be a nuisance or injurious to health; (4) any accumulation
or deposit which is a nuisance or injurious to health; (5) any house
or part of a house so overcrowded as to be dangerous or injurious to
the health of the inmates, whether or not members of the same
family; (6) any factory, workshop or workplace not already under
the operation of any general act for the regulation of factories or
bakehouses not kept in a cleanly state or not ventilated in such a
manner as to render harmless as far as practicable any gases, vapours,
dust or other impurities generated in the course of the work carried on
therein that are a nuisance or injurious to health, or so overcrowded
while work is carried on as to be dangerous or injurious to the health
of those employed therein; (7) any fireplace or furnace which does
not as far as practicable consume the smoke arising from the combustible
used therein, and which is used for working engines by
steam or in any mill, factory, dye-house, brewery, bakehouse or gas
work, or in any manufacturing or trade process whatsoever; and
(8) any chimney not being the chimney of a private dwelling-house
sending forth black smoke in such quantity as to be a nuisance.
The nuisances above enumerated are said to be nuisances liable to
be dealt with summarily. It is the duty of every district council
to inspect their district with a view to the discovery of any such
nuisances. In the event of such discovery by them or of information
given to them of the existence of any such nuisance, the district
council are required to serve a notice requiring the abatement
of the nuisance on the person by whose act, default or sufferance it
arises or continues, or if such person cannot be found, on the owner
or occupier of the premises at which the nuisance arises. The notice
must require the abatement of the nuisance within a specified time,
and must prescribe the works which in the opinion of the council are
necessary to be done. If the nuisance arises from the absence or
defective construction of any structural convenience, or if there is no
occupier of the premises, the notice must be served upon the owner.
If the person who causes the nuisance cannot be found, and it is clear
that the nuisance does not arise or continue by the act, default or
sufferance of the owner or occupier of the premises, the local authority
may themselves abate the nuisance without further order. If the
person on whom the notice is served objects to give effect to it, he
may be summoned before justices, and the justices may make an
order upon him to abate the nuisance, or prohibiting the recurrence
of the nuisance if this is likely, and directing the execution of the
necessary works. If the nuisance is such as to render a dwelling-house
unfit for human habitation, the justices may close it until it is
rendered fit for that purpose. Disobedience under the order of
justices involves a penalty and a daily penalty for every day during
which default continues. Private persons may complain to justices
in respect of nuisances by which they are personally aggrieved, and
if the district council make default in doing their duty, the Local
Government Board may authorize any officer of police to institute
any necessary proceedings at the cost of the defaulting council. The
district council may, if in their opinion proceedings before justices
afford an inadequate remedy, take proceedings in the high court,
but in that case, if the nuisance is of a public nature, they must
proceed by action in the name of the attorney-general. The provisions
as to nuisances are extended to ships by an act of 1885.</p>

<p>It is forbidden to establish within an urban district without the
consent of the council any offensive trade, business or manufacture.
With regard to any offensive trade which has been established or
may be consented to in any urban district, if it is verified by the
medical officer or any two legally qualified medical practitioners, or
by any ten inhabitants of the district, to be a nuisance or injurious
to health, the urban district council are required to take proceedings
before magistrates with a view to the abatement of the nuisance
complained of.</p>

<p>Any medical officer or inspector of nuisances may inspect any
meat, &amp;c., exposed for sale or deposited in any place for the purpose
of sale or of preparation for sale and intended for the
food of man. This power of inspection is, in districts
<span class="sidenote">Unsound meat.</span>
where the Public Health Act 1890 has been adopted,
extended to all articles intended for the food of man. If upon
such inspection the meat, &amp;c., appears to be diseased, unsound or
unwholesome, it may be taken before a justice for the purpose of
being condemned, and the person to whom the meat, &amp;c., belongs
or in whose possession it was found is liable to a penalty or, in the
discretion of the justices, to imprisonment for three months without
the option of a fine.</p>

<p>The Public Health Acts contain important provisions relating to
infectious disease. Any person who knows he is suffering from an
infectious disease must not carry on any trade or business
unless he can do so without risk of spreading the disease.
<span class="sidenote">Infectious diseases.</span>
Local authorities may require premises to be cleansed
and disinfected; they may order the destruction of bedding, clothing
or other articles which have been exposed to infection; they may
provide proper places for the disinfection of infected articles free of
charge; they may provide ambulances, &amp;c. In the case of a person
found suffering from infectious disease who has not proper lodging or
accommodation, or is lodging in a room occupied by more than one
family, or is on board any ship or vessel, such person may by means
of a justice&rsquo;s order be removed to a hospital; a local authority
may pay the expenses of a person in a hospital or, if necessary,
provide nursing attendance; any person exposing himself or any
other in his charge while suffering from infectious disease, or exposing
infected bedding, clothing or the like, is made liable to a penalty.
Owners and drivers of public conveyances must not knowingly convey
any person suffering from infectious disease, and if any person
suffering from such a disease is conveyed in any public vehicle
the owner or driver as soon as it comes to his knowledge must give
notice to the medical officer. It is also forbidden to let houses or
rooms in which infected persons have been lodging, or to make false
statements to persons negotiating for the hire of such rooms. An
act was passed in the year 1890, called the Infectious Diseases
Prevention Act. When adopted it enabled an urban or district
council to obtain the inspection of dairies where these were suspected
to be the cause of infectious disease, with a view to prohibiting the
supply of milk from such dairies if the fact were established. The
act of 1907 extended the provisions of the act of 1890. It enables a
local authority to require dairymen to furnish a complete list of
sources of supply if the medical officer certifies that any person is
suffering from infectious disease which he has reason to suspect is
attributable to milk supplied within his district. It also compels
dairymen to notify infectious diseases existing among their servants.
The act of 1890 also forbids the keeping for more than forty-eight
hours of the body of a person who has died of infectious disease in a
room used at the time as a dwelling-place, sleeping-place or workshop.
It provides for the bodies of persons dying of infectious diseases in a
hospital being removed only for burial, and gives power to justices
in certain cases to order bodies to be buried. The diseases to which
the act applies are smallpox, cholera, membranous croup, erysipelas,
scarlatina or scarlet fever, typhus, typhoid, enteric, relapsing,
continued or puerperal fever, and any other infectious disease to
which the act has been applied by the local authority of the district
in the prescribed manner. The most important provision, however,
relating to infectious disease is that contained in the Infectious
Disease Notification Act 1889. That was originally an adoptive
act, but it is now extended to all districts in England and Wales. It
requires the notification to the medical officer of health of the
district of every case in which a person is suffering from one of the
diseases above mentioned. The duty of notification is imposed upon
the head of the family, and also upon the medical practitioner who
may be in attendance on the patient. The medical attendant is
entitled to receive in respect of each notification a fee of 2s. 6d. if
the case occurs in his private practice, and of 1s. if the case occurs
in his practice as medical officer of any public body or institution.
These fees are paid by the urban or rural district council as the case
may be. The provisions as to notification are applied to every
ship, vessel, boat, tent, van, shed or similar structure used for
human habitation in like manner as nearly as may be as if it were
a building. Exception is made, however, in the case of a ship,
vessel or boat belonging to a foreign government. It is not too
much to say that this act has been one of the most effectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page438" id="page438"></a>438</span>
means of preventing the spread of infectious disease in modern
times.</p>

<p>The district council are empowered to provide hospitals or temporary
places for the reception of the sick. They may build them,
contract for the use of them, agree for the reception of
the sick inhabitants of their district into an existing
<span class="sidenote">Hospitals.</span>
hospital, or combine with any other district council in providing
a common hospital. As has already been mentioned when dealing
with county councils, if a district council make default in providing
hospital accommodation, the county council may put in operation
the Isolation Hospitals Act. The power given to provide hospitals
must be exercised so as not to create a nuisance, and much litigation
has taken place in respect of the providing of hospitals for smallpox.
Up to the present time, however, the courts have refused to accept
as a principle that a smallpox hospital is necessarily a source of
danger to the neighbourhood, and for the most part applications
for injunction on that ground have failed.</p>

<p>Where any part of the country appears to be threatened with
or is affected by any formidable epidemic, endemic or infectious
disease, the Local Government Board may make regulations
for the speedy interment of the dead, house-to-house
<span class="sidenote">Epidemics.</span>
visitation, the provision of medical aid and accommodation,
the promotion of cleansing, ventilation and disinfection, and the
guarding against the spread of disease. Such regulations are made
and enforced by the district councils. The provisions of the
Public Health Acts relating to infectious disease are for the most
part extended to ships by an act of the year 1885.</p>

<p>District councils may, and if required by the Local Government
Board, must provide mortuaries, and they may make by-laws with
respect to the management and charges for the use of
the same. Where the body of a person who has died of an
<span class="sidenote">Mortuaries.</span>
infectious disease is retained in a room where persons live or sleep,
or the retention of any dead body may endanger health, any justice
on the certificate of a medical practitioner may order the removal
of a body to a mortuary and direct the body to be buried
within a time limited by the friends of the deceased or in their default
by the relieving officer. A district council may also provide and
maintain a proper place (otherwise than at a workhouse or at a
mortuary) for the reception of dead bodies during the time required
to conduct any <i>post mortem</i> examination ordered by a coroner.</p>

<p>Under an act of 1879 the district council have power to provide
and maintain a cemetery either within or without their district,
and they may purchase or accept a donation of land
for that purpose. The provisions of the Cemeteries
<span class="sidenote">Cemeteries.</span>
Clauses Act 1847 apply to a cemetery thus provided. These
cannot all be referred to here, but it may be noted that no part
of the cemetery need be consecrated, but that if any part is,
such part is to be defined by suitable marks, and a chapel in connexion
with the Established Church must be erected in it. A chaplain
must also be appointed to officiate at burials in the consecrated
portion. The power to provide a cemetery under the act under consideration
must not be confounded with that of providing a burial
ground under the Burial Acts. These acts will be mentioned later in
connexion with the powers of parish councils, for in general they are
adopted for a parish, part of a parish or combination of parishes,
and are administered by a burial board, except where that body has
been superseded by a parish council or joint committee. It may be
mentioned, however, that under the Local Government Act 1894,
where a burial board district is wholly in an urban district, the
urban council may resolve that the powers, duties and liabilities
of the burial board shall be transferred to the council, and thereupon
the burial board may cease to exist. And it is provided by the
same act that the Burial Acts shall not hereafter be adopted in any
urban parish without the approval of the urban council. The
distinction between a burial ground provided under the Burial
Acts and a cemetery provided under the act of 1879 is important
in many ways, of which one only need be mentioned here&mdash;the
expenses under the Burial Acts are paid out of the poor rate, while
the expenses under the act of 1879 are paid in an urban district
out of the general district rate, the incidence of which differs materially
from that of the poor rate, as will be seen hereafter.</p>

<p>In an urban district the urban council have always had all the
powers and duties of a surveyor of highways under the Highway
Acts. But before 1894 a rural district council had no
power or duty in respect of highways except in a few
<span class="sidenote">Highways.</span>
cases where, by virtue of a provision in the Highway Act 1878,
the rural sanitary authority of a district coincident in area with
a highway district were empowered to exercise all the powers of a
a highway board. Except in these cases the highway authority in
a parish was the surveyor of highways, elected annually by the
inhabitants in vestry, or in a highway district consisting of a number
of parishes united by order of quarter sessions, the highway board
composed of waywardens representing the several parishes. By the
Local Government Act 1894, there were transferred to the district
council of every rural district all the powers, duties and liabilities of
every highway authority, surveyor or highway board within their
district, and the former highway authorities ceased to exist. The
highway authority in every district, rural as well as urban, is therefore
the district council. Of the chief duties of a district council with
regard to highways, the first and most obvious is the duty to repair.
This duty was formerly enforceable by indictment of the inhabitants
of the parish, but it is not quite clear whether this procedure is
applicable, now that the liability to repair is transferred to a council
representing a wider area. Under the Highway Acts it is enforceable
by summary proceedings before justices and by orders of the county
council, but in either case, if the liability to repair is disputed, that
question has to be decided on indictment preferred against the highway
authority alleged to be in default. In a rural district any parish
council may complain to the county council that the district council
have made default in keeping any highway in repair, and the county
council may thereupon transfer to themselves and execute the
powers of the district council at the cost of the latter body, or they
may make an order requiring the district council to perform their
duty, or they may appoint some person to do so at the cost of the
district council. It is important to observe, however, that an
action does not lie against a district council in respect of the failure
to repair a highway even at the suit of a person who has thereby
been injured. The reason assigned for this doctrine is that the
council as highway surveyor stand in the same position as the
inhabitants of the parish, against whom such an action would not
lie. The district council are, however, liable for any injury caused
through negligence on the part of their officers or servants in carrying
out the work of repair.</p>

<p>But while rural as well as urban district councils have the powers
and duties of surveyors of highways, the provisions of the Public
Health Acts relating to streets apply only in urban
districts, except in so far as the Local Government
<span class="sidenote">Streets.</span>
Board may by order have conferred urban powers upon a rural
district council. These provisions have now to be referred to. It
may be convenient to state that the expression &ldquo;street&rdquo; is here
used in a sense much wider than its ordinary meaning. It is defined
by the act to include any highway and any public bridge (not
being a county bridge), and any road, lane, footway, square, court,
alley or passage, whether a thoroughfare or not. For certain
purposes streets as thus defined are divided into two classes, viz.
those which are and those which are not highways repairable by
the inhabitants at large. But it has to be borne in mind that it
is not every highway that is repairable by the inhabitants at large.
Before the year 1836 as soon as a way was dedicated to public use
and the public had by user signified their acceptance of it, it became
without more notice repairable by the parish. Therefore every
highway&mdash;whether carriage-way, driftway, bridleway or footway&mdash;which
can be shown to have been in use before 1836, is presumably
repairable by the inhabitants at large, the only exceptions being
such highways as are repairable by private persons or corporate
bodies <i>ratione clausurae</i>, <i>ratione tenurae</i>, or by prescription. But
in the year 1836, when the Highway Act 1835 came into operation,
the law was altered. It was possible, just as formerly, to dedicate
a way to the use of the public, and it thereupon became a highway
to all intents and purposes. But mere dedication did not make
the way repairable by the public. That result was not to follow
unless certain stringent requirements were fulfilled. When it is
shown, therefore, that a highway has been dedicated after 1836, it
is not repairable by the inhabitants at large unless it can be shown
that these provisions have been complied with, or that it has been
declared to be repairable under provisions of the Public Health Acts
presently to be mentioned. (There was also power given to justices,
by the Highway Act 1862, to declare a private road or occupation
road in a highway district to be a public highway repairable by the
parish; but this power does not appear to have been acted upon to
any extent.)</p>

<p>All streets being highways repairable by the inhabitants at large
within an urban district, are vested in and under the control of the
urban council. After much litigation it has now been established
that this provision does not give the council an absolute property
in the soil of the street, but merely such a qualified property in
the surfaces as enables them to exercise control. The urban council
are required from time to time to cause all such streets to be made
up and repaired as occasion may require, and they are empowered
to raise, lower or alter the soil of the street, and to place and keep
in repair fences and posts for the safety of foot-passengers. The
other class of streets consists of those which are not highways
repairable by the inhabitants at large. Under the Public Health
Act 1875 such streets may be dealt with in manner following:&mdash;If
any such street or part thereof is not sewered, levelled, paved,
metalled, flagged, channelled, made good or lighted to the satisfaction
of the council, the council may cause it to be made up
at the expense of the owners of premises fronting the street in proportion
to their several frontages. When all or any of the works
aforesaid have been executed in the street, and the council are of
opinion that the street ought to become a highway repairable by
the inhabitants at large, they may by notice to be fixed up in the
street declare it to be a highway repairable by the inhabitants at
large, and the declaration will be effective unless, within one month
after the notice has been put up, the majority of the owners in the
street object thereto. An alternative procedure has been provided
by the Private Street Works Act, which may be adopted by any
urban council. One important point of difference is that under
the latter act the council may resolve that the expenses shall be
apportioned among the owners not merely according to frontage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id="page439"></a>439</span>
but according to the greater or less degree of benefit to be derived
by any premises from the works.</p>

<p>Where a house or building in a street is taken down to be rebuilt,
the urban district council may prescribe the line to which it is to
be rebuilt, paying compensation to the building owner for any
damage which he may sustain consequent upon the requirement.
Save to this extent, no power is given by the general law to a district
council to prescribe a building line. But under an act of 1888 it is
provided that it shall not be lawful in any urban district without
the consent of the urban authority to erect or bring forward any
house or building in any street or any part of such house or building
beyond the front main wall of the house or building on either side
thereof in the same street.</p>

<p>The control exercised by an urban district council over streets
and buildings is to a very large extent exercised through by-laws
which they are empowered to make for various purposes relating to
the laying out and formation of new streets, the erection and construction
of new buildings, the provision of sufficient air-space
about buildings to secure a free circulation of air, and the provision
of suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences. The manner in
which such by-laws are made and confirmed will be hereafter noticed.
In general, the by-laws require plans of new streets to be submitted
to the council, and they are required to approve or disapprove of
these plans within a month. They cannot disapprove of a plan unless
it contravenes the provisions of some statute or by-law; but if a
person builds otherwise than according to an approved plan he does
so at the risk of having his work pulled down or destroyed. Among
the miscellaneous powers of an urban council with respect to streets
may be mentioned the power to widen or improve, and certain powers
incorporated from the Towns Improvement Clauses Act 1847, with
respect to naming streets, numbering houses, improving the line of
streets, removing obstructions, providing protection in respect of
ruinous or dangerous buildings, and requiring precautions to be taken
during the construction and repair of sewers, streets and houses.
An urban council may also provide for the lighting of any street in
their district, and may contract with any person or company for
that purpose. If there is no company having statutory powers of
supply within their district, they may themselves undertake the
supply of gas, and they may purchase the undertaking of any gas
company within their district.</p>

<p>An urban council may acquire and maintain lands for the purpose
of being used as public walks or pleasure-grounds, and may support
or contribute to the support of such walks or grounds if
provided by any other person. They may also contribute
<span class="sidenote">Public parks.</span>
to the cost of laying out, planting or improvement of
lands provided for this purpose by any person, in their own district
or outside that district, if it appears that the walks or grounds could
eventually be used by the inhabitants of that district. An urban
council may also provide public clocks or pay for the reasonable
cost of repairing and maintaining any public clocks in the district,
though not vested in them.</p>

<p>Where an urban council are the council of a borough, and in
other cases with the consent of the owners and ratepayers of the
district, they may provide market accommodation for
their district. They may not, however, establish any
<span class="sidenote">Markets and slaughter-houses.</span>
market so as to interfere with any market already established
in the district under a franchise or charter. For
purposes of markets certain provisions of the Markets and
Fairs Clauses Act 1847 are incorporated with the Public Health Act.
The only one of these that need be noticed is that which provides
that after the market is opened for public use every person, other
than a licensed hawker, who shall sell or expose for sale in any place
within the district, except in his own dwelling-place or shop, any
articles in respect of which tolls are authorized to be taken shall be
liable to a penalty. The tolls which may be taken by an urban
council must be approved by the Local Government Board; and
any by-laws which they make for the regulation of the market must
be confirmed by the same body. An urban council may also provide
slaughter-houses and make by-laws with respect to the management
and charges for the use of them. Where they do not provide
slaughter-houses, all previously existing slaughter-houses have to be
registered and new ones licensed; and no person may lawfully use a
slaughter-house which is not either registered or licensed. Licences
may be suspended by justices in the event of their being used
contrary to the provisions of the act or of the by-laws, and on
a second conviction the licence may be revoked. On a conviction
of selling or exposing for sale, or having in his possession
or on his premises unsound meat, the court may also revoke the
licence.</p>

<p>Certain police regulations contained in the Town Police Clauses
Act 1847 are by virtue of the Public Health Act 1875 in force
in all urban districts. These relate to obstructions
and nuisances in streets, fires, places of public resort,
<span class="sidenote">Hackney carriages, &amp;c.</span>
hackney carriages and public bathing. An urban council
may also license proprietors, drivers and conductors of
horses, ponies, mules or asses standing for hiring in the district in
the same way as in the case of hackney carriages, and they may
also license pleasure boats and vessels, and the boatmen or
persons in charge thereof, and they may make by-laws for all these
purposes.</p>

<p>Every district council may enter into such contracts as are necessary
for carrying into execution the various purposes of the Public
Health Acts. A district council being a corporation,
the general law applies in the case of a rural council
<span class="sidenote">Contracts, purchase of lands.</span>
that they must contract under their common seal, the
exception to this rule including the doing of acts very
frequently recurring or too insignificant to be worth the trouble of
affixing the common seal. In the case of an urban council certain
stringent regulations are laid down. A contract made by an urban
council, whereof the value and amount exceed £50, must be under
seal, and certain other formalities must be observed, some of which
are imperative; for example, the taking of sureties from the contractor,
and the making provision for penalties to be paid by him
in case the terms of the contract are not observed. Every local
authority may also, for purposes of the act, purchase or take on
lease, sell or exchange, any lands. Such lands as are not required
for the purpose for which they were purchased must, unless the Local
Government Board otherwise direct, be sold. Powers of compulsory
purchase of lands are also given under the Lands Clauses Acts, but
before these can be put in operation certain conditions must be
observed. The Local Government Board must make inquiry into
the propriety of allowing the lands to be taken, and the power to
acquire the lands compulsorily can only be conferred by means of a
provisional order confirmed by parliament.</p>

<p>With regard to the by-laws which district councils may make
for many purposes, the subjects of which have been already from
time to time mentioned, it is only necessary to state
that these require to be confirmed by the Local Government
<span class="sidenote">By-laws.</span>
Board. Such confirmation does not, however, give validity
to a by-law which cannot be justified by the provisions of the act,
and many by-laws which have been so confirmed have been held
to be invalid under the general law as being uncertain, unreasonable
or repugnant to the law of the realm. For the guidance of local
authorities, the Local Government Board have from time to time
issued model series of by-laws dealing with the various subjects for
which by-laws may be made, and these are for the most part followed
throughout England and Wales.</p>

<p>As a general rule, all the expenses of carrying into execution the
Public Health Acts in an urban district fall upon a fund which is
called the general district fund, and that fund is provided
by means of a rate called the general district rate. To
<span class="sidenote">Finance.</span>
this there are some exceptions. First, in the case of boroughs
where from the time of the first adoption of the Sanitary Acts
these expenses have been paid out of the borough rate, the expenses
continue to be so paid; and in an urban district which was formerly
subject to an Improvement Act, the expenses may be payable out
of the improvement rate authorized by that act. The general
rule, however, prevails over by far the greater part of England
and Wales. The general district rate is made and levied on the
occupiers of all kinds of property for the time being assessable to
any rate for the relief of the poor, subject to a few exceptions and
conditions. Of these the first is that the owner may be rated
instead of the occupier, at the option of the urban authority, where
the value of the premises is under £10, where the premises are let
to weekly or monthly tenants, or where the premises are let in
separate apartments, or the rents become payable or are collected at
any shorter period than quarterly. When the owner is rated he
must be assessed upon a certain proportion only of the net annual
value of the premises. The owners or occupiers of certain specified
properties are assessed in respect of the same in the proportion of
one-fourth part only of the net annual value thereof. These
properties include tithes, tithe commutation rent charge, land used
as arable, meadow or pasture ground only, or as woodlands, market
gardens or nursery grounds, orchards, allotments, any land covered
with water such as the reservoir of a waterworks company, or used
only as a canal or towing-path of the same, or as a railway constructed
under the powers of any Act of Parliament for public
conveyance. The reason for these partial exemptions apparently
is that sanitary arrangements are made chiefly for the benefit of
houses and buildings, while the properties just enumerated do not
receive the same amount of benefit. The only other point to be
noticed in this connexion is that an urban council may divide their
district into parts for all or any of the purposes of the act, rating
each part separately for those purposes. The expenses of highways
in an urban district fall as a rule upon the general district rate,
but under certain conditions, which need not be here set out, a
separate highway rate may have to be levied. The urban council
have extensive powers of amending the rate, and the rate is collected
in such manner as the urban authority may appoint.</p>

<p>The expenses of a rural district council are of two kinds. Of
these the first is called general expenses, and it includes the expense
of the establishment and officers of the council, of disinfection,
providing of conveyance for infected persons, and the expenses of
highways. These expenses are payable out of a common fund
which is raised out of the poor rate of the several parishes in the
district, according to the rateable value of each. Special expenses
include the expenses of the construction and maintenance and
cleansing of sewers, providing water-supply, and all other expenses
incurred or payable in respect of a parish or contributory place
within the district determined by order of the Local Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page440" id="page440"></a>440</span>
Board to be special expenses. The expression &ldquo;contributory place&rdquo;
means a place other than a parish chargeable with special expenses.
For the most part it has reference only to what is called a special
drainage district, that is to say, a district formed out of one or more
parishes or parts of parishes for the purpose of the provision of a
common water-supply, or scheme of sewerage, or the like, and in the
event of such a district including part only of a parish, the remaining
portion would, so far as the special expenses for which the district
was created are concerned, be a separate contributory place. These
special expenses are chargeable to each parish or contributory place,
and they are defrayed by means of special sanitary rates, such rates
being raised on all property assessed to the relief of the poor, but
with the same exemptions of certain properties as have been mentioned
under the head of general district rate in urban districts.</p>

<p>District councils are empowered to borrow with the sanction of
the Local Government Board, subject to certain restrictions and
regulations. The money must be borrowed for permanent
works, the expenses of which ought in the opinion of the
<span class="sidenote">Borrowing powers.</span>
Local Government Board to be spread over a term of years
which must not exceed sixty. The sums borrowed must not
exceed, with the outstanding loans, the amount of the assessable
value for two years of the district for which the money is borrowed;
and if the sum borrowed would, with the outstanding loans, exceed
the assessable value for one year, the sanction of the Local Government
Board may not be given except after local inquiry. The money
may be repaid by equal instalments of principal, or of principal and
interest, or by means of a sinking fund.</p>

<p>Where the urban council are the council of a borough, their
accounts as urban council are made up and audited in the same
ineffective manner as has already been mentioned in
the case of the accounts of the council under the Municipal
<span class="sidenote">Audit.</span>
Corporations Act, but each of the borough auditors receives remuneration
for auditing the accounts of the council as urban district
council. Where the urban council are not the council of a borough,
the accounts are made up annually, and audited by the district
auditor in the same effective manner as has already been mentioned
in the case of the accounts of a county council. The accounts of a
rural district council are made up half-yearly and are audited in
the same way.</p>

<p>The Public Authorities Protection Act 1893 was passed to repeal
the numerous provisions contained in many acts of parliament,
whereby, before legal proceedings could be taken against a
public body, notice of action had to be given and the
<span class="sidenote">Proceedings against district councils.</span>
proceedings commenced within a certain limited time.
The act applies to all public authorities, including, of
course, district councils, and it provides in effect that
where any action or legal proceeding is taken against a
council for any act done in pursuance or execution, or intended
execution, of an act of parliament, or of any public duty or authority,
the action must be commenced within six months next after the act,
neglect or default complained of, or in the case of a continuance of
injury or damage, within six months next after the ceasing thereof.
And it provides further that, in the event of the judgment of the
court being given in favour of the council, the council shall be entitled
to recover their costs taxed as between solicitor and client. Notice of
action is abolished in every case.</p>

<p>Among other acts which are either incorporated with the Public
Health Acts or have been passed subsequently to them, one of the
most important is the Housing of the Working Classes Act
1890. It contains three distinct parts. Under the first an
<span class="sidenote">Housing of the working classes.</span>
urban district council may, by means of a scheme, acquire,
rearrange and reconstruct an area which has been proved
to be insanitary. The scheme has to be confirmed by the
Local Government Board, and carried out by means of a provisional
order. The second part of the act deals with unhealthy dwelling-houses,
and requires the urban district council to take steps for the
closing of any dwelling-houses within their district which are unfit
for human habitation. The third part of the act deals with what is
called in the act working-class lodging-houses. But the expression is
a little misleading, for it includes separate houses or cottages for the
working classes, whether containing one or several tenements, and
the expression &ldquo;cottage&rdquo; may include a garden of not more than
half an acre, provided that the estimated annual value of such garden
shall not exceed £3. This part of the act may be adopted by a rural
district council, but an urban district council can carry it into execution
without formal adoption. Land may be acquired for erecting
lodging-houses as above defined, and these, when erected, may be
managed and let by the council.</p>

<p>The urban district council may adopt the provisions of the Baths
and Washhouses Acts, and thereunder provide public
<span class="sidenote">Baths and wash-houses.</span>
baths, wash-houses, open bathing-places, covered swimming
baths, which they may close in the winter months
and use as gymnasia.</p>

<p>Under the Tramways Act 1870 the urban district council may
obtain from the Board of Trade a provisional order authorizing the
construction of tramways in their district by themselves.
Any private persons, and any corporation or company
<span class="sidenote">Tramways.</span>
may, with the consent of the council, obtain the like authority,
but the Board of Trade have power in certain cases to dispense
with the consent of the local authority. Where the order is obtained
by a person or body other than the district council, the council may
purchase the undertaking at the end of twenty-one years after the
tramways have been constructed or at the expiration of every
subsequent period of seven years, and the terms of purchase are
that the person or company must sell the undertaking upon payment
of the then value, exclusive of any allowance for past or future profits
of the undertaking, or any compensation for compulsory sale or other
consideration whatsoever of the tramway, and all lands, buildings,
works, materials and plant suitable to and used for the purposes of
the undertaking. It should be observed, however, that although
the local authority may themselves construct, and may acquire
from the original promoters a system of tramways, they may not
themselves work them without special authority of the legislature,
and must in general let the working of the undertaking to some
person or company.</p>

<p>Under the Borough Funds Act 1872 the urban district council
may, if in their judgment it is expedient, promote or oppose any
local and personal bill or bills in parliament, or may
prosecute or defend any legal proceedings necessary for
<span class="sidenote">Bills in Parliament and legal proceedings.</span>
the promotion or protection of the interests of the district,
and may charge the costs incurred in so doing to the
rates under their control. The power to incur parliamentary
costs, however, is subject to several important
restrictions. The resolution to promote or oppose the bill must
in the first instance have been carried by an absolute majority
of the whole number of the council at a meeting convened by special
notice, and afterwards confirmed by the like majority. The resolution
must have been published in newspapers circulated in the
district, and must have received the consent of the Local Government
Board or of a secretary of state, if the matter is one within his
jurisdiction; and further, the expenses must not be incurred unless
the promotion or opposition has been assented to by the owners
and ratepayers of the district assembled at a meeting convened
for the purpose of considering the matter, and if necessary, signified
by a poll. Moreover, the expenses must, before they can be charged
to the rates, be examined and allowed by some person authorized
by a secretary of state or the Local Government Board, as the case
may be.</p>

<p>Under the Pawnbrokers Act 1872 the licences to pawnbrokers,
which were formerly granted by justices, are now granted by district
councils.</p>

<p>Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts certain important duties
devolve upon medical officers and inspectors of nuisances who are
officers of district councils. But for the most part the
acts do not impose upon district councils themselves
<span class="sidenote">Adulteration.</span>
any special powers or duties, although, as a matter of
fact, prosecutions for offences are usually undertaken by the district
councils, and the expenses of the execution of the acts are paid
out of their funds. In quarter sessions boroughs, however, where
the council have the duty of appointing a public analyst, they are
under an obligation to put the acts in force from time to time, as
occasion may arise. The acts themselves must be consulted for the
procedure, beginning with the taking of samples and ending with the
conviction of an offender.</p>

<p>The powers and duties of a district council under the Rivers
<span class="sidenote">Rivers pollution.</span>
Pollution Prevention Act 1876 have been incidentally
noticed when dealing with county councils, whose powers
under the acts are precisely the same.</p>

<p>Under the Electric Lighting Acts the Board of Trade may license
any district council to supply electricity, or may grant to them a
provisional order for the same purpose. A similar
licence or order may be granted to a private person or
<span class="sidenote">Electric lighting.</span>
company to supply electricity within the district of a
district council, but in that case the consent of the district council
must be given, unless the Board of Trade, for special reasons,
dispense with such consent. These licences are now rarely applied
for or granted, and the provisions which were formerly contained
in the provisional orders have now been consolidated by the Electric
Lighting Clauses Act 1899, the effect of which will be to make
provisional orders uniform for the future. It is now almost the
exception, at least in urban districts, to find a district council
which has not obtained a provisional order under these acts, and
for the most part the undertakings of local authorities in the way
of supplying electricity have been very prosperous.</p>

<p>Under the Allotment Acts district councils were empowered to
provide allotments for the labouring population of their district,
if they were satisfied that there was a demand for allotments,
that these could not be obtained at a reasonable
<span class="sidenote">Allotments.</span>
rent by voluntary arrangement, and that the land could
be let at such a price as would not involve a loss to the council.
The district council might acquire land, let it and regulate it, and
they might provide common pasture. These powers were, by an
act of 1907, transferred to parish councils.</p>

<p>The urban district council execute the Public Libraries Acts for
their district, and the rate for the expenses of the acts, which may
not exceed 1d. in the £, is in a borough in the nature
of a borough rate, and in any other urban district in
<span class="sidenote">Public libraries.</span>
the nature of a general district rate. Under the acts
not only public libraries, but also public museums, schools for
science, art galleries and schools for art, with the necessary buildings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page441" id="page441"></a>441</span>
furniture, fittings and conveniences, may be provided for the inhabitants
of the district. Land may be acquired, and money
borrowed, for the purposes of the acts.</p>

<p>A great number of other statutes confer powers or impose duties
upon district councils, such as the acts relating to town gardens,
agricultural gangs, fairs, petroleum, infant life protection, commons,
open spaces, canal boats, factories and workshops, margarine, sale of
horse-flesh and shop hours.</p>
</div>

<p>Before the passing of the Local Government Act 1894 there
was really nothing in the form of local government for a parish.
It is true that the inhabitants in vestry had certain
powers. They could adopt various acts, which will be
<span class="sidenote">The parish and the parish council.</span>
more particularly referred to hereafter, and they could
appoint the persons who were to carry these acts into
execution. They elected the churchwardens and overseers, the
highway surveyor, if the parish was a separate unit for highway
purposes, and the waywardens if it was included in a highway
district. But there was nothing in the nature of a representative
body exercising any powers of government in the parish regarded
as a separate area. Under the act of 1894 this was changed. In
every rural parish, that is to say, in every parish which is not
included within an urban district, there is a parish meeting, which
consists of the parochial electors of the parish. As already stated,
these are the persons whose names are on the parliamentary and
local government registers. If the parish has a population
exceeding 300, a parish council must be elected. If it has a
population of 100 or upwards, the county council are bound to
make an order for the election of a parish council if the parish
meeting so resolves. Where there is no parish council, as will be
seen hereafter, the various powers conferred upon a council are
exercised by the parish meeting itself. Two or more parishes may
be grouped together under a common parish council by order of
the county council if the parish meetings of each parish consent.
An annual parish meeting in every rural parish must be held on
the 25th day of March or within seven days before or after that
date; and if there is no parish council, there must be at least one
other parish meeting in the year. At the annual parish meeting
the parish council, if there is one, is elected, and the members of
the council, who originally held office for one year only, now,
under a subsequent act, hold office for three years. Any person
who is a parochial elector, or who has for twelve months preceding
the election resided in the parish, or within 3 m. thereof, may be
elected parish councillor, and the number of councillors is to be
fixed from time to time by the county council, not being less than
five nor more than fifteen. Women, whether married or single,
are eligible.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The council are elected in manner provided by the rules of the
Local Government Board. The rules now in force will be found
in the <i>Statutory Rules and Orders</i>. They are very similar to those
which are in force with reference to the elections of district councils,
which have already been noticed. If a poll is demanded, it must be
taken under the Ballot Act, as applied by the rules, and for all
practical purposes it may be taken that the election proceeds in
the same manner as that of a district council. The parish council
elects a chairman annually. He may be one of their own number,
or some other person qualified to be a parish councillor. The council
is a body corporate, may hold land in mortmain, and can appoint
committees for its own parish or jointly with any other parish council.
<span class="sidenote">Powers to appoint overseers.</span>
Among the powers conferred upon a parish council are
those of appointing overseers and of appointing and revoking
the appointment of assistant overseers. Churchwardens
are no longer overseers, and the parish council
may appoint as overseers a number of persons equal to the number
formerly appointed as overseers and churchwardens. It may be
useful to mention here that for purposes of the administration of
the poor law, overseers no longer act, their duties in that respect
having been superseded by the guardians. They remain, however,
the rating authority so far as regards the poor rate and nearly
all other rates, the exceptions being the general district rate in an
urban district and the borough rate in a borough, made by the
town council. They still have power to give relief to poor persons
in case of sudden and urgent necessity, but their principal duty is
that of rating authority, and they are bound to make out the lists
for their parishes of jurors and electors. No payment is made to
them. The office is compulsory, but certain persons are privileged
from being elected to it. The assistant overseer, who was formerly
nominated by the inhabitants and vestry and then formally appointed
by justices, is now, as has been stated, appointed by the parish
council. He holds office at pleasure, and receives such remuneration
as the council fix, and he performs all the duties of an overseer,
or such of them as may be prescribed by the terms of his appointment.
There may be in a parish a collector of rates appointed by the
guardians. In that event, an assistant overseer cannot be appointed
to perform the duties of collector of rates, but, on the other hand,
the parish council may invest the collector with any of the powers
of an overseer. The parish council may appoint a clerk, who may be
either one of their own number without payment, or the assistant
overseer, rate collector or some other fit person, with remuneration.</p>

<p>Among the duties transferred to parish councils may be mentioned
the provision of parish books and of a vestry room or parochial
office, parish chest, fire engine or fire escape, the holding
or management of parish property, other than property
<span class="sidenote">Powers and duties of parish councils.</span>
relating to affairs of the church or held for an ecclesiastical
charity, the holding or management of village greens or
of allotments, the appointment of trustees of parochial
charities other than ecclesiastical charities in certain cases, and
certain limited powers with reference to the supply of water to the
parish, the removal of nuisances, and the acquisition of rights of way
which are beneficial to the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Among the most important of the matters which concern a rural
parish is the administration of what are commonly called the adoptive
acts. These include the Lighting and Watching Act, the
Baths and Washhouses Acts, the Burial Acts, the Public
<span class="sidenote">Lighting and Watching Act.</span>
Improvement Act and the Public Libraries Acts. The
Lighting and Watching Act was formerly adopted for a
parish, or part of a parish, by the inhabitants in vestry,
who elected lighting inspectors, of whom one-third went out of office
in every year. The inspectors took the necessary steps for having
the parish lighted (the provisions as to watching having been obsolete
for many years), and the expenses of lighting were raised by the
overseers upon an order issued to them by the inspectors. The
owners and occupiers of houses, buildings and property, other than
land, pay a rate in the £ three times greater than that at which the
owners and occupiers of land are rated and pay for the purposes of
the act. Now this act, like the other adoptive acts, can only be
adopted by the parish meeting, and where adopted for part only of a
parish, must be adopted by a parish meeting held for that part.
After the adoption of the act it is carried into execution by the parish
council, if there is one, and if not, by the parish meeting, and the
expenses are raised in the same manner as heretofore.
<span class="sidenote">Baths and Washhouses Acts.</span>
The Baths and Washhouses Acts have already been
referred to in dealing with district councils, and it is
sufficient to say that they are now adopted and administered
in a rural parish in the manner pointed out
with reference to the Lighting and Watching Act. The same may
be said of the Burial Acts, but these are sufficiently important
<span class="sidenote">Burial Acts.</span>
to require special notice. These acts contain provisions
whereby burials may be prohibited in urban districts, and
churchyards or burial grounds already existing may be
closed when full. Formerly, when the acts had been adopted by the
vestry, it was necessary to appoint a burial board to carry the acts
into execution and provide and manage burial grounds. Now, in a
rural parish which is coextensive with an area for which the acts
have been adopted, the burial board is abolished and the acts are
administered by the parish council; and the acts cannot be adopted
in a rural parish save by the parish meeting. If the area under a
burial board in 1894 was partly in a rural parish and partly in an
urban district, the burial board was superseded, and the powers of the
board are exercised by a joint committee appointed partly by the urban
district council and partly by the parish council, or parish meeting,
as the case may be. In a rural parish where there is no parish council,
though the acts are adopted by the parish meeting, it is still necessary
to elect the burial board, and that board will be elected by the parish
meeting. The distinction between a burial ground under the Burial
Acts and a cemetery provided under the Public Health Acts has
already been noticed. A burial ground, properly so called, has to
be divided into consecrated and unconsecrated portions, and the
former really takes the place of the parish churchyard; and the
incumbent of the parish church, the clerk, and the sexton continue
to receive the same fees upon burials in the consecrated portion as
they would have done in the parish churchyard. It has been
mentioned that a portion of the burial ground must be left unconsecrated.
But this is subject to one important exception, that
the parish meeting may unanimously resolve that the whole of the
burial ground shall be consecrated. In that case, however, the
parish council may, within ten years thereafter, determine that a
separate unconsecrated burial ground shall also be provided for the
parish. The expenses of the execution of the Burial Acts are provided
by the overseers out of the poor rate upon the certificate of
the body entrusted with the execution of them. In the event of
the acts being adopted for a portion only of a rural parish, the
burial board, or the parish meeting, may by resolution transfer all
the powers of the board to the parish council.</p>

<p>The Public Improvement Act, when adopted, enables a parish
council to purchase or lease, or accept gifts of land for the purpose
of forming public walks, exercise or play grounds, and
to provide for the expense by means of a parish improvement
<span class="sidenote">Public Improvement Act.</span>
rate. Before any such rate is imposed, however,
a sum in amount not less than at least half of the estimated
cost of the proposed improvement must have been raised by private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page442" id="page442"></a>442</span>
subscription or donation, and the rate must not exceed sixpence
in the £.</p>

<p>The Public Libraries Acts enable the authority adopting them to
provide public libraries, museums, schools for science, art galleries
and schools for art. The expenses in a rural parish are
defrayed by means of a rate raised with, and as part of,
<span class="sidenote">Public Libraries Acts.</span>
the poor rate, with a qualification to the effect that agricultural
land, market gardens and nursery grounds are
to be assessed to the rate at one-third only of their rateable value.</p>

<p>The expenses of a parish council may not, without the consent of
a parish meeting, exceed the amount of a rate of threepence in the
£ for the financial year; but with the consent of the
parish meeting the limit may be increased to sixpence,
<span class="sidenote">Finance: expenses of parish council.</span>
exclusive of expenses under the adoptive acts. If it
is necessary to borrow, the consent of the parish meeting
and of the county council must be obtained. The
expenses are payable out of the poor rate by the overseers on the
precept of the parish council.</p>

<p>One of the most important powers conferred upon a parish council
is that which enables them to prevent stoppage or diversion of any
public right of way without their consent and without the approval
of the parish meeting. The council may also complain to the county
council that the district council have failed to sewer their parish or
provide a proper water-supply, or generally to enforce the provisions
of the Burial Acts; and upon such complaint, if ascertained to be
well founded, the county council may transfer to themselves the
powers and duties of the district council, or may appoint a competent
person to perform such powers and duties. In a parish which is not
sufficiently large to have a parish council, most of the powers and
duties conferred or imposed on the parish council are exercised by
the parish meeting. It may be convenient here to add that where,
under the Local Government Act 1894, the powers of a parish council
are not already possessed by an urban district council, the Local
Government Board may by order confer such powers on the urban
council. This has been done almost universally, as far as regards
the power to appoint overseers and assistant overseers, and in many
cases urban councils have also obtained powers to appoint trustees
of parochial charities.</p>
</div>

<p>The foregoing is a sketch of the scheme of local government
carried out in England and Wales. No attempt has been made
to deal with poor law (<i>q.v.</i>) or education (<i>q.v.</i>). The
local administration of justice devolving upon the
<span class="sidenote">General observations.</span>
justices in quarter or petty sessions is hardly a matter
of local government, although in one important respect,
that, namely, of the licensing of premises for the sale of intoxicating
liquors, it may be thought that the duties of justices fall
within the scope of local government. It will be seen that the
scheme, as at present existing, has for its object the simplification
of local government by the abolition of unnecessary independent
authorities, and that this has been carried out almost completely,
the principal exception being that in some cases burial boards
still exist which have not been superseded either by urban
district councils or by parish councils or parish meetings. There
are also some matters of local administration arising under what
are called commissions of sewers. These exist for the purpose
of regulating drainage, and providing defence against water in
fen lands or lands subject to floods from rivers or tidal waters.
The commissioners derive their authority from the Sewers
Commission Acts, which date from the time of Henry VIII.,
from the Land Drainage Act 1861, and from various local acts.
It is unnecessary, however, to consider in any detail the powers
exercised by commissioners of sewers in the few areas under
their control.</p>

modern publications, out of a great mass of works of more or less
popular character, there may be mentioned the well-known series of
<i>Murray&rsquo;s Guides</i>, in which each volume treats of a county or group
of counties.</p>

<p>Early in the 20th century the <i>Victoria History of the Counties of
England</i> (dedicated to Queen Victoria) began to appear; its volumes
deal with each county from every aspect&mdash;natural history, prehistoric
and historic antiquities, ethnography, history, economic conditions,
topography and sport being dealt with by authorities in all branches.</p>

<p>The maps of the Ordnance, Geological and Hydrographic Surveys
delineate the configuration and geology of England and the adjacent
seas with a completeness unsurpassed in any other country. For
ordinary detailed work the best series of maps is found in Bartholomew&rsquo;s
<i>Survey Atlas of England and Wales</i> (Edinburgh Geographical

<p><span class="bold">ENGLAND, THE CHURCH OF.<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> The Church of England
claims to be a branch of the Catholic and Apostolic Church;
it is episcopal in its essence and administration, and is established
by law in that the state recognizes it as the national church of
the English people, an integral part of the constitution of the
realm. It existed, in name and in fact, as the church of the
English people centuries before that people became a united
nation, and, in spite of changes in doctrine and ritual, it remains
the same church that was planted in England at the end of the
6th century. From it the various tribes which had conquered
the land received a bond of union, and in it they beheld a pattern
of a single organized government administered by local officers,
to which they gradually attained in their secular polity. In
England, then, the state is in a sense the child of the church.
The doctrines of the English Church may be gathered from its
Book of Common Prayer (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prayer, Book of Common</a></span>) as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page443" id="page443"></a>443</span>
finally revised in 1661, with the form of ordaining and consecrating
bishops, priests and deacons, with the exception of the
services for certain days which were abrogated in 1859; from
the XXXIX Articles (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Creeds</a></span>), published with royal authority
in 1571; and from the First and Second Books of Homilies of
1549 and 1562 respectively, which are declared in Article XXXV.
to contain sound doctrine.</p>

<p><i>Precursors.</i>&mdash;Christianity reached Britain during the 3rd
century, and perhaps earlier, probably from Gaul. An early
tradition records the death of a martyr Alban at
Verulamium, the present St Albans. A fully grown
<span class="sidenote">Christianity in Roman Britain.</span>
British Church existed in the 4th century: bishops
of London, York and Lincoln attended the council
of Arles in 314; the church assented to the council of Nicaea
in 325, and some of its bishops were present at the council of
Rimini in 359. The church held the Catholic faith. Britons
made pilgrimages, to Rome and to Palestine, and some joined
the monks who gathered round St Martin, bishop of Tours.
Among these was Ninian, who preached to the southern Picts,
and about 400 built a church of stone on Wigton Bay; its
whiteness struck the people and their name for it is commemorated
in the modern name Whithorn. From northern Britain,
St Patrick (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Patrick, St</a></span>) went to accomplish his work as the
apostle of Ireland. Early in the 5th century Britain was infected
by the heresy of Pelagius, himself a Briton by birth, but in 429
Germanus, bishop of Auxerre, and Lupus, bishop of Troyes,
recalled the church to orthodoxy and, according to tradition,
led their converts to victory, the &ldquo;Hallelujah victory,&rdquo; over the
Picts and Scots. When the Britons were hard pressed by Saxon
invaders large bodies of them found shelter in western Armorica,
in a lesser Britain, which gave its name to Brittany. A British
Church was founded there, and bishops, scholars and recluses of
either Britain seem constantly to have visited the other. The
Saxon invasion cut off Britain from communication with Rome;
<span class="sidenote">The British church.</span>
and the British Church having no share in the progressive
life of the Roman Church, differences gradually
arose between them. The organization of the British
Church was monastic, its bishops being members,
usually abbots, of monasteries, and not strictly diocesan, for the
monasteries to which the clergy were attached had a tribal
character. The monastic communities were large, Bangor
numbered 2000 monks. From Gildas, a British monk, who
wrote about 550, we gather that the bishops were rich and
powerful and claimed apostolical succession; that though
governed by synods the church lacked discipline; that simony
was rife, and that bishops and clergy were neglectful. He
evidently draws too dark a picture, for religious activity was not
extinct. Gildas himself and others preached in Ireland, and
from them the Scots, the dominant people of Ireland, received
a ritual. The organization of the Scotic Church in Ireland was
similar to that of the British Church. Its monastic settlements
or schools were many and large, and were the abodes of learning.
Bishops dwelt in them and were reverenced for their office, but
each was subject to the direction of the abbot and convent.
In 565 (?) St Columba, the founder and head of several Scotic
monasteries, left Ireland and founded a monastery in Hii or
Iona, which afforded gospel teaching to the Scots of Dalriada
and the northern Picts, and later did a great work in evangelizing
many of the Teutonic conquerors of Britain. By 602 the British
Church, in common with the Irish Scots, followed practices
which differed from the Roman use as it then was; it kept
Easter at a different date; its clergy wore a different tonsure,
and there was some defect in its baptismal rite. The conquerors
of Britain&mdash;Saxons, Angles and Jutes&mdash;were heathens; the
Britons gradually retreated before them to Wales, and to western
and northern districts, or dwelt among them either as slaves
or as outlaws hiding in swamps and forests, and they made no
attempts to evangelize the conquering race.</p>

<p>About 587 a Roman abbot, Gregory, afterwards Pope Gregory
the Great, is said to have seen some English boys exposed for
sale in Rome and asked of what people they were, of what
kingdom and who was their king. They were &ldquo;Angli,&rdquo; he was
<span class="sidenote">Foundation of the English church.</span>
told, of Deira, the modern Yorkshire, and their king was Ælle.
&ldquo;Not &lsquo;Angli,&rsquo;&rdquo; said he, struck with the beauty of the fair-haired
boys, &ldquo;but &lsquo;angeli&rsquo; (angels), fleeing from wrath
(<i>de ira</i>), and Ælle&rsquo;s people must sing Alleluia.&rdquo; He
wished himself to go as a missionary to the English,
but was prevented. After he became pope he sent
a mission to England headed by Augustine. The way was
prepared, for Æthelberht, king of Kent, had married a
Christian, a Frankish princess Berhta, and allowed her to
worship the true God. She brought with her a bishop who
ministered to her in St Martin&rsquo;s church outside Canterbury,
but evidently made no effort to spread the faith. Augustine
and his band landed probably at Ebbsfleet in 597. They were
well received by Æthelberht, who was converted and baptized.
On the 16th of November Augustine was consecrated by the
archbishop of Arles to be the archbishop of the English, and
by Christmas had baptized 10,000 Kentish men. Thus the
fathers of the English Church were Pope Gregory and St Augustine.
Augustine restored a church of the Roman times at
Canterbury to be the church of his see. The mission was reinforced
from Rome; and Gregory sent directions for the rule
of the infant church. There were to be two archbishops, at
London and York; London, however, was not fully Christianized
for some years, and the primatial see remained at Canterbury.
Augustine held two conferences with British bishops; he bade
them give up their peculiar usages, conform to the Roman ritual,
and join him in evangelizing the English. His haughtiness is
said to have offended them; they refused, and the English Church
owes nothing to its British predecessor. The mission prospered,
and bishops were consecrated for Rochester, and for London
for the East Saxons. After Augustine and Æthelberht died
a short religious reaction took place in Kent, and the East
Saxons apostatized. In 627 Edwin, king of Northumbria, who
had married a daughter of Æthelberht, was converted and
baptized with his nobles by Paulinus, who became the first
bishop of York. As Edwin&rsquo;s kingdom extended from the
Humber to the Forth and included the Trent valley, while he
exercised superiority over all the other English kingdoms, except
Kent, his conversion promised well for the church, but he was
slain and his kingdom overrun by Penda, the heathen king of
Mercia, the central part of England. Penda&rsquo;s victories endangered
the cause of Christianity. The Roman mission was
dying out. Kent and East Anglia, which was evangelized by
Felix, a Burgundian bishop sent from Canterbury, were settled
in the faith. Though Bernicia, the northern part of Northumbria,
was little affected by the gospel, and after Edwin&rsquo;s death
heathenism became dominant in his kingdom, Christianity did
not die out in Northumbria. The East Saxons had heard the
gospel, and in 634 the conversion of the West Saxons was begun
by Birinus, an Italian missionary. Central England and the
South Saxons, however, were wholly untouched by Christianity.</p>

<p>The work of the Romans was taken up by Scotic missionaries.
Oswald, under whom the Northumbrian power revived, had lived
as an exile among the Scots, and asked them for a bishop to teach
his people. Aidan was sent to him by the monks of Iona in 635,
and fixed his see in Lindisfarne, or Holy Island, where he founded
a monastery. Saintly, zealous and supported by Oswald&rsquo;s
influence, he brought Northumbria generally to accept the
gospel. The conversion of the Middle Angles and Mercians, and
the reconversion of the East Saxons, were also achieved by Scots
or by disciples of the Scotic mission. After Aidan&rsquo;s death in 651
the differences between the Roman and Scotic usages, and specially
that concerning the date of Easter, led to bitter feelings, were
inconvenient in practice, and must have hindered the church in
its warfare against heathenism. Oswio, who reigned over both the
Northumbrian kingdoms, was, like his brother Oswald, a disciple
of the Scots, his son and his queen, the daughter of Edwin, held
to the Roman usages, and these usages were maintained by
Wilfrid, who on his return from Rome in 658 was appointed abbot
of Ripon. By Oswio&rsquo;s command a conference between the two
parties was held at the present Whitby in 664. Oswio decided in
favour of the Roman usages. This was the end of the Scotic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page444" id="page444"></a>444</span>
mission. The Scots left Lindisfarne, and their disciples generally
adopted the Roman usages. The Scots were admirable missionaries,
holy and self-devoted, and building partly on Roman
foundations and elsewhere breaking new ground, they and their
English disciples, as Ceadda (St Chad), bishop of the Mercians,
and Cuthbert, bishop of Lindisfarne, who were by no means
inferior to their teachers, almost completed the conversion of the
country. But they practised an excessive asceticism and were
apt to abandon their work in order to live as hermits. Great as
were the benefits which the English derived from their teaching,
its cessation was not altogether a loss, for the church was passing
beyond the stage of mission teaching and needed organization,
and that it could not have received from the Scots.</p>

<p>Its organization like its foundation came from Rome. An
archbishop-designate who was sent to Rome for consecration
having died there, Pope Vitalian in 668 consecrated
Theodore of Tarsus as archbishop of Canterbury. The
<span class="sidenote">Organization of the English Church.</span>
Scots had no diocesan system, and the English
bishoprics were vast in extent, followed the lines of the
kingdoms and varied with their fortunes. The church had no
system of government nor means of legislation. Theodore united
it in obedience to himself, instituted national synods and subdivided
the over-large bishoprics. At his death, in 690, the
English dominions were divided into fourteen dioceses. Wilfrid,
who had become bishop of Northumbria, resisted the division of
his diocese and appealed to the pope. He was imprisoned by the
Northumbrian king and was exiled. While in exile he converted
the South Saxons, and their conversion led to that of the Isle of
Wight, then subject to them, in 686, which completed the
evangelization of the English. After long strife Wilfrid, who was
supported by Rome, regained a part of his former diocese.
Theodore also gave the church learning by establishing a school at
Canterbury, where many gained knowledge of the Scriptures, of
Latin and Greek, and other religious and secular subjects. In
the north learning was promoted by Benedict Biscop in the sister
monasteries which he founded at Wearmouth and Jarrow.
There Bede (<i>q.v.</i>) received the learning which he imparted to
others. In the year of Bede&rsquo;s death, 735, one of his disciples,
Ecgbert, bishop of York, became the first archbishop of York,
Gregory III. giving him the <i>pallium</i>, a vestment which conferred
archiepiscopal authority. He established a school or university
at York, to which scholars came from the continent. His work as
a teacher was carried on by Alcuin, who later brought learning to
the court and Frankish dominions of Charlemagne. The infant
church, following the example of the Irish Scots, showed much
missionary zeal, and English missionaries founded an organized
church in Frisia and laboured on the lower Rhine; two who
attempted to preach in the old Saxon land were martyred.
Most famous of all, Winfrid, or St Boniface, the apostle of
Germany, preached to the Frisians, Hessians and Thuringians,
founded bishoprics and monasteries, became the first archbishop
of Mainz, and in 754 was martyred in Frisia. He had many
English helpers, some became bishops, and some were ladies, as
Thecla, abbess of Kitzingen, and Lioba, abbess of Bischofsheim.
After his death, Willehad laboured in Frisia, and later, at the
bidding of Charlemagne, among the Saxons, and became the first
bishop of Bremen. Religion, learning, arts, such as transcription
and illumination, flourished in English monasteries. Yet heathen
customs and beliefs lingered on among the people, and in Bede&rsquo;s
time there were many pseudo-monasteries where men and women
made monasticism a cloak for idleness and vice. In the latter
part of the 8th century Mercia became the predominant kingdom
under Offa, and he determined to have an archbishop of his own.
By his contrivance two legates from Adrian I. held a council at
Chelsea in 787 in which Lichfield was declared an archbishopric,
and seven of the twelve suffragan bishoprics of Canterbury were
apportioned to it. In 802, however, Leo III. restored Canterbury
to its rights and the Lichfield archbishopric was abolished.</p>

<p>The rise of Wessex to power seems to have been aided by a
good understanding between Ecgbert and the church, and his
successors employed bishops as their ministers. Æthelred, who
was specially under ecclesiastical influence, went on a pilgrimage
to Rome, and before his departure made large grants for
pious uses. His donation, though not the origin of tithes
<span class="sidenote">Later Anglo-Saxon times.</span>
in England, illustrates the idea of the sacredness of
the tenth of income on which laws enforcing the
payment of tithes were founded. His pilgrimage
was probably undertaken in the hope of averting
the attacks of the pagan Danes. Their invasions fell heavily
on the church; priests were slaughtered and churches sacked
and burnt. Learning disappeared in Northumbria, and things
were little better in the south. Bishops fought and fell in
battle, the clergy lived as laymen, the monasteries were
held by married canons, heathen superstitions and immorality
prevailed among the laity. Besides bringing the Danish
settlers in East Anglia to profess Christianity in 878, Alfred
set himself to improve the religious and intellectual condition
of his own people (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Alfred</a></span>). The gradual reconquest
of middle and northern England by his successors was
accompanied by the conversion of the Danish population. A
revival of religion was effected by churchmen inspired by the
reformed monasticism of France and Flanders, by Odo, archbishop
of Canterbury, Oswald, archbishop of York, and Dunstan
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dunstan</a></span>), who introduced from abroad the strict life of the
new Benedictinism. King Edgar promoted the monastic reform,
and by his authority Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester turned
canons out of the monasteries and put monks in their place.
Dunstan sought to reform the church by ecclesiastical and secular
legislation, forbidding immorality among laymen, insisting on the
duties of the clergy, and compelling the payment of tithes and
other church dues. After Edgar&rsquo;s death an anti-monastic
movement, chiefly in Mercia, nearly ended in civil war. In this
strife, which was connected with politics, the victory on the
whole lay with the monks&rsquo; party, and in many cathedral churches
the chapters remained monastic. The renewed energy of the
church was manifested by councils, canonical legislation and
books of sermons. In the homilies of Abbot Ælfric, written for
Archbishop Sigeric, stress is laid on the purely spiritual presence
of Christ in the Eucharist, but his words do not indicate, as some
have believed, that the English Church was not in accord with
Rome. The ecclesiastical revival was short-lived. Renewed
Danish invasions, in the course of which Archbishop Alphege was
martyred in 1012, and a decline in national character, injuriously
affected the church and, though in the reign of Canute it was
outwardly prosperous, spirituality and learning decreased.
Bishoprics and abbacies were rewards of service to the king, the
bishops were worldly-minded, plurality was frequent, and simony
not unknown. Edward the Confessor promoted foreign ecclesiastics;
the connexion with Rome was strengthened, and in 1062
the first legates since the days of Offa were sent to England by
Alexander II. A political conflict led to the banishment of Robert,
the Norman archbishop of Canterbury. An Englishman Stigand
received his see, but was excommunicated at Rome, and was
regarded even in England as schismatical. When William of
Normandy planned his invasion of England, Alexander II., by
the advice of Hildebrand, afterwards Gregory VII., moved
doubtless by this schism and by the desire to bring the English
Church under the influence of the Cluniac revival and into closer
relation with Rome, gave the duke a consecrated banner, and the
Norman invasion had something of the character of a holy war.</p>

<p>Before the Norman Conquest the church had relapsed into
deadness: English bishops were political partisans, the clergy
were married, and discipline and asceticism, then the
recognized condition of holiness, were extinct. The
<span class="sidenote">Norman times.</span>
Conqueror&rsquo;s relations with Rome ensured a reform;
for the papacy was instinct with the Cluniac spirit. In 1070
papal legates were received and held a council by which Stigand
was deposed. Lanfranc, abbot of Bec, was appointed archbishop
of Canterbury and worked harmoniously with the king
in bringing the English Church up to the level of the church in
Normandy. Many native bishops and abbots were deposed,
and the Norman prelates who succeeded them were generally
of good character, strict disciplinarians, and men of grander
ideas. A council of 1075 decreed the removal of bishops&rsquo; sees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page445" id="page445"></a>445</span>
from villages to towns, as on the continent; the see of Sherborne,
for example, was removed to Old Sarum, and that of Selsey to
Chichester, and many churches statelier than of old were built
in the Norman style which the Confessor had already adopted
for his church at Westminster. In another council priests and
deacons were thenceforward forbidden to marry. William and
Lanfranc also worked on Hildebrandine lines in separating
ecclesiastical from civil administration. Ecclesiastical affairs
were regulated in church councils held at the same time as the
king&rsquo;s councils. Bishops and archdeacons were no longer to
exercise their spiritual jurisdiction in secular courts, as had been
the custom, but in ecclesiastical courts and according to canon
law. The king, however, ruled church as well as state; Gregory
granted him control over episcopal elections, he invested bishops
with the crozier and they held their temporalities of him, and
he allowed no councils to meet and no business to be done without
his licence. Gregory claimed homage from him; but while the
king promised the payment of Peter&rsquo;s pence and such obedience
as his English predecessors had rendered, he refused homage;
he allowed no papal letters to enter the kingdom without his
leave, and when an anti-pope was set up, he and Lanfranc
treated the question as to which pope should be acknowledged
in England as one to be decided by the crown. The Conquest
brought the church into closer connexion with Rome and gave
it a share in the religious and intellectual life of the continent;
it stimulated and purified English monasticism, and it led to
the organization of the church as a body with legislative and
administrative powers distinct from those of the state. The
relations established by the Conqueror between the crown, the
church and the pope, its head and supreme judge, worked well
as long as the king and the primate were agreed, but were so
complex that trouble necessarily arose when they disagreed.
William Rufus tried to feudalize the church, to bring its officers
and lands under feudal law; he kept bishoprics and abbacies
vacant and confiscated their revenues. He quarrelled with
Anselm (<i>q.v.</i>) who succeeded Lanfranc. Anselm while at Rome
heard the investiture of prelates by laymen denounced, and he
maintained the papal decree against Henry I. Bishops were
vassals of the king, holding lands of him, as well as officers of the
church. How were they to be appointed? Who should invest
them with the symbols of their office? To whom was their
homage due? (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Investiture</a></span>). These questions which
agitated western Europe were settled as regards England by a
compromise: Henry surrendered investiture and kept the right
to homage. The substantial gain lay with the crown, for, while
elections were theoretically free, the king retained his power
over them. Though Henry in some degree checked the exercise
of papal authority in England, appeals to Rome without his
sanction were frequent towards the end of his reign. Stephen
obtained the recognition of his title from Innocent II., and was
upheld by the church until he violently attacked three bishops
who had been Henry&rsquo;s ministers. The clergy then transferred
their allegiance to Matilda. His later quarrel with the papacy,
then under the influence of St Bernard, added to his embarrassments
and strengthened the Angevin cause.</p>

<p>During Stephen&rsquo;s reign the church grew more powerful than
was for the good either of the state or itself. Its courts encroached
on the sphere of the lay courts, and further
claimed exclusive criminal jurisdiction over all clerks
<span class="sidenote">The Angevin kings.</span>
whether in holy or minor orders, with the result
that criminous clerks, though degraded by a spiritual
court, escaped temporal punishment. Henry II., finding
ecclesiastical privileges an obstacle to administrative reform,
demanded that the bishops should agree to observe the ancient
customs of the realm. These customs were, he asserted, expressed
in certain constitutions to which he required their assent at a
council at Clarendon in 1164. In spirit they generally maintained
the rights of the crown as they existed under the Conqueror.
One provided that clerks convicted of temporal crime in a
spiritual court and degraded should be sentenced by a lay court
and punished as laymen. Archbishop Becket (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Becket</a></span>)
agreed, repented and refused his assent. The king tried to ruin
him by unjust demands; he appealed to Rome and fled to France.
A long quarrel ensued, and in 1170 Henry was forced to be
reconciled to Becket. The archbishop&rsquo;s murder consequent on
the king&rsquo;s hasty words shocked Christendom, and Henry did
penance publicly. By agreement with the pope he renounced
the Constitutions, but the encroachments of the church courts
were slightly checked, and the king&rsquo;s decisive influence on
episcopal elections and some other advantages were secured.
The church in Wales had become one with the English Church
by the voluntary submission of its bishops to the see of Canterbury
in 1192 and later. The Irish Church remained distinct,
though the conquest of Ireland, which was sanctioned by the
English pope Adrian IV. (Nicholas Breakspear), brought it into
the same relations with the crown as the English Church and into
conformity with it. Under the guidance of ecclesiastics employed
as royal ministers, the church supported the crown until, in
1206, Innocent III. refused to confirm the election of a bishop
nominated by King John to Canterbury; and representatives
of the monks of Christ Church, in whom lay the right of election,
being at his court, the pope bade them elect Stephen Langton
whom he consecrated as archbishop. John refused to receive
Langton and seized the estates of Christ Church. Innocent
laid England under an interdict in 1208; the king confiscated
the property of the clergy, banished bishops and kept sees
vacant. Papal envoys excommunicated him and declared him
deposed in 1211. Surrounded by enemies, he made his peace
with the pope in 1213, swore fealty to him before his envoy,
acknowledged that he held his kingdom of the Roman see, and
promised a yearly tribute for England and Ireland. Finally he
surrendered his crown to a legate and received it back from him.
The banished clergy returned and an agreement was made as to
their losses. Langton guided the barons in their demands on
the king which were expressed in Magna Carta. The first clause
provided, as charters of Henry I. and Stephen had already
provided, that the English Church should be &ldquo;free,&rdquo; adding that
it should have freedom of election, which John had promised
in 1214. As John&rsquo;s suzerain, Innocent annulled the charter,
suspended Langton, and excommunicated the barons in arms
against the king. On John&rsquo;s death, Gualo, legate of Honorius
III., with the help of the earl marshal, secured the throne for
Henry III., and he and his successor Pandulf, as representatives
of the young king&rsquo;s suzerain, largely directed English affairs
until 1221, when Pandulf&rsquo;s departure restored Langton to his
rightful position as head in England of the church. Reforms
in discipline and clerical work were inculcated by provincial
legislation, and two legates, Otho in 1237 and Ottoboni in 1268,
promulgated in councils constitutions which were a fundamental
part of the canon law in England. Religious life was quickened
by the coming of the friars (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Friars</a></span>). Parochial organization
was strengthened by the institution of vicars in benefices held
by religious bodies, which was regulated and enforced by the
bishops. It was a time of intellectual activity, in character
rather cosmopolitan than national. English clerks studied
philosophy and theology at Paris or law at Bologna; some
remained abroad and were famous as scholars, others like
Archbishops Langton, and Edmund Rich, and Bishop Grosseteste
returned to be rulers of the church, and others like Roger
Bacon to continue their studies in England. The schools of
Oxford, however, had already attained repute, and Cambridge
began to be known as a place of study. The spirit of the age
found expression in art, and English Gothic architecture, though
originally, like the learning of the time, imported from France,
took a line of its own and reached its climax at this period.
Henry&rsquo;s gratitude for the benefits which in his early years he
received from Rome was shown later in subservience to papal
demands. Gregory IX., and still more Innocent IV., sorely in
need of money to prosecute their struggle with the imperial
house, laid grievous taxes on the English clergy, supported the
king in making heavy demands upon them, and violated the
rights of patrons by appointing to benefices by &ldquo;provisions&rdquo;
often in favour of foreigners. Churchmen, and prominently
Grosseteste, the learned and holy bishop of Lincoln, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page446" id="page446"></a>446</span>
recognizing the pope as the divinely appointed source of all
ecclesiastical jurisdiction, were driven to resist papal orders
which they held to be contrary to apostolic precepts. Their
remonstrances were seldom effectual, and the state of the
national church was noted by the Provisions of Oxford in 1258
as part of the general misgovernment which the baronial opposition
sought to remedy. The alliance between the crown and
the papacy in this reign diminished the liberties of the church.</p>

<p>Edward I., who was a strong king, checked an attempt to
magnify the spiritual authority by the writ <i>Circumspecte agatis</i>,
which defined the sphere of the ecclesiastical courts,
put a restraint on religious endowments by the Statute
<span class="sidenote">13th and 14th centuries.</span>
of Mortmain, and desiring that every estate in the
realm should have a share in public burdens and
counsels, caused the beneficed clergy to be summoned to send
proctors to parliament. The clergy preferred to make their grants
in their own convocations, and so lost the position offered to
them. For some years clerical taxation by the crown was carried
on with the good-will of the papacy; it was not oppressive for
unbeneficed clergy and incomes below ten marks were exempt,
and in theory the clergy were celibate. Papal demands, however,
were additional burdens. In 1296 Boniface VIII., by his bull
<i>Clericis laicos</i>, forbade the clergy to grant money to lay princes,
and Edward&rsquo;s request for a clerical subsidy was in 1297 refused by
convocation led by Archbishop Winchelsea. The king thereupon
outlawed the clergy. The northern province yielded, the
southern held out longer; but finally the clergy made their peace
severally, each paying his share, and the royal victory was
complete. Winchelsea joined the baronial opposition which
forced Edward to grant the &ldquo;Confirmation of the Charters.&rdquo;
Edward procured his disgrace from Clement V., and in return
allowed Clement to exact so much from the church that the
doings of the papal agents provoked an indignant remonstrance
from parliament in 1307. With that exception the king&rsquo;s
dealings with the church were statesmanlike. He employed
clerical ministers and paid them by church preferments, but his
nominations to bishoprics did not always receive papal confirmation
which had become recognized as essential. His weak son
Edward II. yielded readily to papal demands. The majority of
the bishops of the reign, and specially those engaged in politics,
were unworthy men; religion was at a low ebb; plurality and
non-residence were common. By the constitution <i>Execrebilis</i>
John XXII. ordered that all cures held in plurality save one
should be vacated, and, which was not so well, &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; all
benefices so vacated for his own appointment. As the residence
of the popes at Avignon from 1308 to 1377 brought them under
French influence, Englishmen during the war with France were
specially displeased that large sums should be drawn from the
kingdom for them and that they should exercise patronage
there. In the reign of Edward III. the popes, though appointing
to bishoprics by provision, did not give them to foreigners,
but they appointed foreigners, enemies of England, to lesser
preferments, deaneries and prebends. In 1351 the Statute of
Provisors declared provisions unlawful. Capitular elections,
however, remained mere forms; the king nominated, and the
popes provided, and took advantage of their claim to appoint to
sees vacant by translation. Papal interference in suits concerning
temporalities was checked by a law of 1353 (the first statute of
<i>Praemunire</i>), which made punishable by outlawry and forfeiture
the carrying before a foreign tribunal of causes cognizable by
English courts. This measure was extended in 1365, and in
1393 by the great statute of <i>Praemunire</i>. Indignant at the law of
1365, Urban V. demanded payment of the tribute promised by
John, which was then thirty-three years in arrear, but parliament
repudiated the claim. The Black Death disorganized the church
by thinning the ranks of the clergy, who did their duty manfully
during the plague. In the diocese of Norwich, for example, 800
parishes lost their incumbents in 1349, 83 of them twice over
(Jessopp). Large though insufficient numbers were instituted
to benefices and unfit persons received holy orders. The value of
livings decreased and many lay vacant. Some incumbents
deserted their parishes to take stipendiary work in towns or secular
employments, and unbeneficed clergy demanded higher stipends.
Greediness infected the church in common with society at large.
Yet Chaucer&rsquo;s ideal parish priest must have represented a familiar
type, so that we may believe that much good work was here
and there unobtrusively done by the clergy. Prominent among
abuses were the sale of pardons, and the extortions of the ecclesiastical
courts; their decrees were enforced by excommunication,
and on a writ issued to the sheriff an excommunicated person
would be imprisoned until he satisfied the demands of the church.
The state needed money and attacks were made in parliament on
the wealth of the church. Already, in 1340, Edward III., who
quarrelled with Archbishop Stratford on political grounds, had
appointed lay ministers, and in 1371 William of Wykeham,
bishop of Winchester, and other clerical ministers were turned out
of office and succeeded by laymen. A political crisis in 1376 was
followed by a struggle between the bishops and John of Gaunt,
duke of Lancaster, the head of the anticlerical party, who allied
himself with John Wycliffe (<i>q.v.</i>). He was unpopular, and when
the bishops cited Wycliffe before them in St Paul&rsquo;s, the duke&rsquo;s
conduct provoked a riot and the proceedings ended abruptly.
Wycliffe held that the church was corrupted by wealth; that
only those in grace had a right to God&rsquo;s gifts, and that temporal
power belonged only to laymen and not to popes nor priests.
Later he attacked the papacy itself, which in 1378 was distracted
by the great schism; by 1380 he condemned pilgrimages, secret
confession and masses for the dead. While holding the presence
of Christ in the Eucharist, he denied a change of substance in the
elements, arguing that accidents or qualities, such as form and
colour, could not exist without substance. He taught that Holy
Scripture was the only source of religious truth, to the exclusion
of church authority and tradition, and he and his followers made
the first complete English version of the Bible. His opinions
were spread by the poor priests whom he sent out to preach and
by his English tracts. That his teaching had any direct effect on
the insurrection of 1381, though commonly believed, appears to
be an unfounded idea; many priests were concerned in the
rising, and specially the mendicant orders, Wycliffe&rsquo;s bitter
enemies, but the motives of the insurrection were essentially
secular (Oman, <i>The Great Revolt of 1381</i>). The reaction which
followed extended to religion, and Wycliffe&rsquo;s doctrines were
condemned by a church council in 1382. Nevertheless he died in
peace. He had many disciples, especially in Oxford and in
industrial centres. The Lollards, as his followers were called,
had supporters in parliament and among people of high rank in
the court of Richard II., and the king&rsquo;s marriage to Anne of
Bohemia brought about the importation of Wycliffe&rsquo;s writings
into Bohemia, where they had a strong influence on the religious
movement led by Hus. At first the bishops were not inclined to
persecute, and the earlier Lollards mostly recanted under
pressure, but their number increased.</p>

<p>With the accession of the Lancastrian house the crown allied
itself with the church, and the bishops adopted a repressive
policy towards the Lollards. By the canon law
obstinate heretics were to be burnt by the secular
<span class="sidenote">The 15th century.</span>
power, and though England had hitherto been almost
free from heresy, one or two burnings had taken place in accordance
with that law. In 1401 a statute, <i>De heretico comburendo</i>,
ordered that heretics convicted in a spiritual court should be
committed to the secular arm and publicly burned, and, while this
statute was pending, one Sawtre was burned as a relapsed heretic.
Henry V. was zealous for orthodoxy and the persecution of
Lollards increased; in 1414 Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham,
who had been condemned as a heretic, escaped and made an
insurrection; he was taken in 1417 and hanged and burned.
Lollardism was connected with an insurrection in 1431; it then
ceased to have any political importance, but it kept its hold in
certain towns and districts on the lower classes; many Lollards
were forced to recant and others suffered martyrdom. The
church was in an unsatisfactory state. As regards the papacy,
the crown generally maintained the position taken up in the
previous century, but its policy was fitful, and the custom
of allowing bishops who were made cardinals to retain their sees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page447" id="page447"></a>447</span>
strengthened papal influence. The bishops were largely engaged
in secular business; there was much plurality, and cathedral
and collegiate churches were frequently left to inferior officers
whose lives were unclerical. The clergy were numerous and
drawn from all classes, and humble birth did not debar a man
from attaining the highest positions in the church. Candidates
for holy orders were still examined, but clerical education seems
to have declined. Preaching was rare, partly from neglectfulness
and partly because, in 1401, in order to prevent the spread
of heresy, priests were forbidden to preach without a licence.
While the marriage of the clergy was checked, irregular and
temporary connexions were lightly condoned. Discipline generally
was lax, and exhortations against field-sports, tavern haunting
and other unclerical habits seem to have had little effect.
Monasticism had declined. Papal indulgences and relics were
hawked about chiefly by friars, though these practices were
discountenanced by the bishops. On the other hand, all education
was carried on by the clergy, and religion entered largely into
the daily life of the people, into their gild-meetings, church-ales,
mystery-plays and holidays, as well as into the great events of
family life&mdash;baptisms, marriages and deaths. Many stately
churches were built in the prevailing Perpendicular style, often
by efforts in which all classes shared, and many hamlet chapels
supplemented the mother church in scattered parishes. The
revival of classical learning scarcely affected the church at large.
Greek learning was regarded with suspicion by many churchmen,
but the English humanists were orthodox. The movement had
little to do with the coming religious conflicts, which indeed
killed it, save that it awoke in some learned men like Sir Thomas
More a desire for ecclesiastical, though not doctrinal, reform, and
led many to study the New Testament of which Erasmus published
a Greek text and Latin paraphrases.</p>

<p>During the earlier years of the 16th century Lollardism still
existed among the lower classes in towns, and was rife here and
there in country districts. Persecution went on and
martyrdoms are recorded. The old grievances concerning
<span class="sidenote">The Reformation era.</span>
ecclesiastical exactions remained unabated and
were further strengthened by an ill-founded rumour
that Richard Hunne, a Londoner who had refused to pay a
mortuary, was imprisoned for heresy in the Lollards&rsquo; tower, and
was found hanged in his cell in 1514, had been murdered.
Lutheranism affected England chiefly through the surreptitious
importation of Tyndale&rsquo;s New Testament and heretical books.
In 1521 Henry VIII. wrote a book against Luther in which he
maintained the papal authority, and was rewarded by Leo X.
with the title of Defender of the Faith. Henry, however, whose
will was to himself as the oracles of God, finding that the pope
opposed his intended divorce from Catherine of Aragon, determined
to allow no supremacy in his realm save his own. He
carried out his ecclesiastical policy by parliamentary help.
Parliament was packed, and was skilfully managed; and he had
on his side the popular impatience of ecclesiastical abuses, a new
feeling of national pride which would brook no foreign interference,
the old desire of the laity to lighten their own burdens
by the wealth of the church, and a growing inclination to question
or reject sacerdotal authority. He used these advantages to
forward his policy, and when he met with opposition, enforced his
will as a despot. The parliament of 1529 lasted until 1536; it
broke the bonds of Rome, established royal supremacy over the
English Church, and effected a redistribution of national wealth
at the expense of the spirituality. It began by acts abolishing
ecclesiastical exactions, such as excessive mortuaries and fees for
probate, and by prohibiting pluralities except in stated cases,
application to Rome for licence to evade the act being made
penal. Henry having crushed his minister Cardinal Wolsey,
archbishop of York, declared the whole body of the clergy
involved in a <i>praemunire</i> by their submission to Wolsey&rsquo;s legatine
authority, and ordered the convocation to purchase pardon by a
large payment, and by acknowledging him as &ldquo;Protector and
Supreme Head of the English Church and Clergy.&rdquo; After much
debate, the acknowledgment was made in 1531, with the qualification
&ldquo;so far as the law of Christ allows.&rdquo; A &ldquo;supplication&rdquo;
against clerical jurisdiction and legislation by convocation was
obtained from the Commons in 1532, and Henry received from
convocation the &ldquo;submission of the clergy,&rdquo; surrendering its
legislative power except on royal licence, and consenting to a
revision of the canon law by commissioners to be appointed by the
king. A bill for conditionally withholding the payment of
<i>annates</i>, or first-fruits, to Rome was passed, and Henry took
advantage of the fear of the Roman court lest it should lose these
payments, to obtain without the usual fees bulls promoting
Cranmer to the see of Canterbury in 1533, and thus was enabled
to gain his divorce. Cranmer pronounced his marriage to
Catherine null, and declared him lawfully married to Anne
Boleyn. Clement VII. retorted by excommunicating the king,
but for that Henry cared not. Appeals to Rome were forbidden
by statute, and the council ordained that the pope should
thenceforth only be spoken of as bishop of Rome, as not having
authority in England. In 1534 the restraint of annates was
confirmed by law, all payments to Rome were forbidden, and it
was enacted that, on receiving royal licence to elect, cathedral
chapters must elect bishops nominated by the king. The papal
power was extirpated by statute, parliament at the same time
declaring that neither the king nor kingdom would vary from the
&ldquo;Catholic faith of Christendom.&rdquo; The submission of the clergy
was made law. Appeals from the archbishops&rsquo; courts were to be
to the king in chancery, and were to be heard by commissioners,
whence arose the Court of Delegates as the court of final appeal
in ecclesiastical cases. The first-fruits and tenths of benefices
were given to the king, and his title as &ldquo;Supreme Head in earth
of the Church of England&rdquo; was declared by parliament without
the qualification added by convocation. Fisher, bishop of
Rochester, and Sir Thomas More, lately chancellor, the two most
eminent Englishmen, were beheaded in 1535 on an accusation of
attempting to deprive the king of this title, and some Carthusian
monks suffered a more cruel martyrdom in the same cause.
Meanwhile New Testaments were burnt, and heretics, or reformers,
forced to abjure or, remaining steadfast, were sent to the
stake, for though the heresy law of Henry IV. was repealed,
heresy was still punishable by death, and persecution was not
abated. By breaking the bonds of Rome Henry did not give the
church freedom; he substituted a single despotism for the dual
authority which pope and king had previously exercised over it.
In 1535 Cromwell, the king&rsquo;s vicar-general, began a visitation of
the monasteries. The reports (<i>comperta</i>) of his commissioners
having been delivered to the king and communicated to parliament
in 1536, parliament declared the smaller monasteries
corrupt, and granted the king all of less value than £200 a year.
A rebellion in Lincolnshire and another in the north, the formidable
Pilgrimage of Grace, followed. The suppression of the greater
houses was effected gradually, surrenders were obtained by
pressure, and three abbots who were reluctant to give up the
possessions of their convents for confiscation were hanged.
Monastic shrines and treasuries were sacked and the spoil sent to
the king, to whom parliament granted all the houses, their lands
and possessions. Of the enormous wealth thus gained Henry
spent a part on national defence, a little on the foundation of the
bishoprics of Westminster, dissolved in 1550, Bristol, Chester,
Gloucester, Oxford and Peterborough, and gave the lands to men
either useful to or favoured by himself, or sold them to rich
purchasers. In 1536 he dictated the belief and ceremonial of the
church by issuing Ten Articles which were subscribed by convocation.
This first formulary of the English Church as separate
from Rome did not contravene Catholic doctrine, though it
showed the influence of Lutheran models. Another exposition of
Anglican doctrine was made in the <i>Institution of a Christian Man</i>
or &ldquo;Bishops&rsquo; book,&rdquo; in some respects more likely to satisfy those
attached to the tenets of Rome, in others, as in the distinct
repudiation of purgatory and the declaration that salvation
depended solely on the merits of Christ, showing an advance.
It was published in 1537 with Henry&rsquo;s sanction but not by
authority. In that year licence was granted for the sale of a
translation of the Bible, and in 1538 another version called
Matthew&rsquo;s Bible, was ordered to be kept in all churches (see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page448" id="page448"></a>448</span>
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bible</a></span>). Pilgrimages were suppressed and images used for
worship destroyed. Denial of the king&rsquo;s supremacy, denial of
the corporal presence in the Eucharist, and insults to Catholic
rites were alike punished by cruel death. The publication abroad
of the king&rsquo;s excommunication rendered an assertion of orthodoxy
advisable for political reasons, and in 1539 came the Act of the
Six Articles attaching extreme penalties to deviations from
Catholic doctrines. The backward swing of the pendulum
continued; Cromwell was beheaded and three reforming
preachers were burnt in 1540. Prosecutions for heresy under the
act were fitful: four gospellers were burnt in London in 1546,
of whom the celebrated Anne Askew was one. Cranmer, however,
did not lose the king&rsquo;s favour. A fresh attempt to define
doctrine was made in the <i>Necessary Doctrine and Erudition of a
Christian Man</i>, the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Book,&rdquo; published by authority in
1543, which, while repudiating the pope, was a declaration of
Catholic orthodoxy. A <i>Primer</i>, or private prayer-book, of which
parts were in English, as the litany composed by Cranmer, and
virtually the same as at present, was issued in 1546, and further
liturgical change seemed probable when Henry died in 1547.</p>

<p>Henry, while changing many things in the church, would not
allow any deviation in essentials from the religion of Catholic
Europe, which was not then so dogmatically defined as it was
later by the council of Trent. Edward VI. was a child, and the
Protector Somerset and the council favoured further changes,
which were carried out with Cranmer&rsquo;s help. They issued a
book of <i>Homilies</i> and a set of injunctions which were enforced
by a royal visitation. Pictures and much painted glass were
destroyed in churches, frescoed walls were whitewashed, and
in 1548, the removal of all images was decreed. Parliament
ordered that bishops should be appointed by letters patent and
hold their courts in the king&rsquo;s name. An act of the last reign
granting the king all chantries and gilds was enlarged and
enforced with cruel injustice to the poor. On the petition of
convocation parliament allowed the marriage of priests; and
it further ordered that the laity should receive the cup in communion.
A communion book was issued by the council in
English, the Latin mass being retained for a time. Many
German reformers came to England, were favoured by the
council, and gained influence over Cranmer. The first Book
of Common Prayer was authorized by an Act of Uniformity in
1549; it retained much from old service books, but the communion
office is Lutheran in character. It excited discontent,
and a serious insurrection broke out in the West, the insurgents
demanding the revival of the Act of the Six Articles and the
withdrawal of the new service as &ldquo;like a Christmas game.&rdquo;
After Somerset&rsquo;s fall the government rapidly pushed forward
reformation. A new <i>Ordinal</i> issued with parliamentary approval
in 1550 was significant of the change in sacramental doctrine,
and the four minor orders disappeared. Altars were destroyed
and tables substituted. Five bishops, Bonner of London,
Gardiner of Winchester, and Heath of Worcester, then already
in prison, and two others, were deprived; and the Lady Mary,
who would not give up the mass, was harshly treated. The
reformers were not tolerant; for a woman was burnt for Arianism
in 1550 and a male Anabaptist in 1551. Under the influence
of foreign reformers, who took a lower view of the Eucharist
than the Lutheran divines, Cranmer soon advanced beyond the
prayer-book of 1549. A second prayer-book, departing further
from the old order, appeared in 1552, and without being accepted
by convocation was enforced by another Act of Uniformity, and
in 1553 a catechism and forty-two articles of religion were
authorized by Edward for subscription by the clergy, though
not laid before convocation. A revision of the canon law in
accordance with the act for &ldquo;submission of the clergy&rdquo; was at
last undertaken in 1551, but the only result was a document
entitled <i>Reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum</i>, which never received
authority. Edward died in 1553. Apart from matters of faith,
the church had fared ill under a royal supremacy exercised by
self-seeking nobles in the name of the boy-king. Convocation
lost all authority and bishops were treated as state officials
liable to deprivation for disobedience to the council. Means of
worship were diminished, and the poor were shamefully wronged
by the suppression of chantries, gilds and holy days; even the
few sheep of the poor brethren of a gild were seized to swell a
sum which from 1550 was largely diverted from public purposes
to private gain. Churches were despoiled of their plate; the
old bishops were forced, the new more easily persuaded, to give
up lands belonging to their sees, and rich men grew richer by
robbing God.</p>

<p>When Mary succeeded her brother, the deprived bishops
were restored, some reforming bishops were imprisoned, and
Cranmer, who was implicated in the plot on behalf of Lady
Jane Grey, was attainted of treason. As regards doctrine,
religious practices and papal supremacy, Mary was set on
bringing back her realm to the position existing before her
father&rsquo;s quarrel with Rome. Her first parliament repealed the
ecclesiastical legislation of Edward&rsquo;s reign, and convocation
formally accepted transubstantiation. Seven bishops were
deprived in 1554, four of them as married, and about a fifth of
the beneficed clergy, though some received other benefices after
putting away their wives. Apparently Mary at first believed
that her authority would be accepted in religious matters; but
she met with opposition, partly provocative, for Wyat&rsquo;s rebellion
consequent on her intended marriage to Philip of Spain
was closely connected with religion, and more largely passive
in the noble resolution of those who chose martyrdom rather
than denial of their faith. To the nation at large, though not
averse from the old doctrines and practices of the church, a
return to the Roman obedience was distasteful. Nevertheless,
Cardinal Pole was received as legate, and the title of Supreme
Head of the Church having been dropped, a parliament carefully
packed, and the fears of the rich appeased by the assurance that
they would not have to surrender the monastic lands, he absolved
the nation in parliament and reunited it to the Church of Rome
on November 30, 1554, the clergy being absolved in convocation.
Parliament repealed all acts against the Roman see since the
twentieth year of Henry VIII. The heresy laws were revived,
and a horrible persecution of those who refused to disown the
doctrines of the prayer-book began in 1555, and lasted during
the remainder of the reign. Nearly 300 persons were burned
to death as heretics in these four years, among them being five
bishops: Hooper of Gloucester, Ferrar of St David&rsquo;s, Ridley
of London, and Latimer (until 1539) of Worcester in 1555, and
Archbishop Cranmer in 1556. The chief responsibility for these
horrors rests with the queen; the bishops who examined the
accused were less zealous than she desired. The most prominent
among them in persecution was Bonner of London. The exiles
for religion were received at Frankfort, Strassburg and Zürich.
At Frankfort a party among them objected to the ceremonies
retained in the prayer-book, and, encouraged by Calvin and by
Knox, who came to them from Geneva, quarrelled with those
who desired to keep the book unchanged. Mary died in 1558.
Her reign arrested the rapid spoliation of the church and possibly
prevented the adoption of doctrines which would have destroyed
its apostolic character; the persecution by which it was disgraced
strengthened the hold of the reformed religion on the
people and made another acceptance of Roman supremacy for
ever impossible.</p>

<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s accession was hailed with pleasure; she was
known to dislike her sister&rsquo;s ecclesiastical policy, and a change
was expected. An Act of Supremacy restored to the
crown the authority over the church held by Henry
<span class="sidenote">Elizabethan settlement.</span>
VIII., and provided for its exercise by commissioners,
whence came the court of High Commission nominated
by the crown, as a high ecclesiastical court; but Elizabeth
rejected the title of Supreme Head, and used that of Supreme
Governor, as &ldquo;over all persons and in all cases within her
dominions supreme.&rdquo; An Act of Uniformity prescribed the
use of the prayer-book of 1552 in a revised form which raised
the level of its doctrine, and injunctions enforced by a royal
visitation re-established the reformed order. All the Marian
bishops save two refused the oath of supremacy and were deprived,
and eight were imprisoned. Of the clergy generally few refused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page449" id="page449"></a>449</span>
it; for only some 200 were deprived for religion during the first
six years of the reign. Bishops for the vacant sees were nominated
by the crown and elected by their chapters as in Henry&rsquo;s reign;
Matthew Parker was canonically consecrated archbishop of Canterbury.
The orthodoxy of the church was vindicated by Bishop
Jewel&rsquo;s <i>Apologia ecclesiae Anglicanae</i>. Adherents to Rome
vainly tried to obtain papal sanction for attending the church
services, and were forced either to disobey the pope or become
&ldquo;recusants&rdquo;; many were fined, and those who attended mass
were imprisoned. Meanwhile a party, soon known as Puritans,
rebelled against church order; the exiles who had come under
Genevan influence objecting on their return to vestments and
ceremonies enjoined by the prayer-book. There was much nonconformity
in the church which the queen ordered the bishops
to correct. Parker, though averse to violent measures, insisted
on obedience to his &ldquo;Advertisements&rdquo; of 1566, which,
though not formally authorized by the queen, expressed her
will, and became held as authoritative, and some of the refractory
were punished. A company engaged in irregular worship was
discovered in London in 1567 and a few persons were imprisoned
by the magistrate. Active opposition to the government was
stirred up by Pius V., and in 1569 a rebellion in the north, where
the old religion was strong, was aided by papal money and
encouraged by hopes of Spanish intervention. In 1570 Pius
published a bull excommunicating and deposing the queen.
Thenceforward recusants had to choose between loyalty to the
queen and loyalty to the pope. They lay under suspicion, and
severe penal laws were enacted against Romish practices. About
1579 many seminary priests and Jesuits came over to England
as missionaries; some actively engaged in treason, all were
legally traitors. The country was threatened with foreign
invasion, plots against the government were detected, and the
queen&rsquo;s life was held to be endangered. The council hunted
down these priests and their abettors, and many were executed,
martyrs to the doctrine of the pope&rsquo;s power of deposition.
The number put to death in this reign under the penal laws was
187. The papal policy defeated itself; a large number of the old
religion while retaining their faith chose to be loyal to the queen
rather than lend themselves to the designs of her enemies. From
1571 recusants can no longer be reckoned as nonconforming
members of the English Church: the law recognized them as
separate from it. The church&rsquo;s doctrine was defined in the
catechism of 1570, and in the revised articles of religion which
appeared as the XXXIX. Articles in 1571, and its law by a body
of canons published with authority in 1576, the attempt at
codification made in the <i>Reformatio legum</i> having been laid
aside.</p>

<p>From 1574 the Protestant Nonconformists strove to introduce
Presbyterianism. Cause for grievance existed in the state of
the church which had suffered from the late violent
changes. Elizabeth plundered it, and laymen who
<span class="sidenote">The Nonconformists.</span>
owned the rectories formerly held by monasteries
followed her example; bishoprics were impoverished
by the queen and parish cures by her subjects, and the reform of
abuses was checked by self-interest. As bishops, along with some
able men, Elizabeth chose others of an inferior stamp who consented
to the plunder of their sees and whom she could use
to report on recusants and harry nonconformists. Separation,
or Independency, began about 1578 with the followers of Robert
Browne, who repudiated the queen&rsquo;s ecclesiastical authority;
two Brownists were executed in 1583. The nonconformists
remained in the church and continued their efforts to subvert its
episcopal system. Elizabeth, though personally little influenced
by religion, understood the political value of the church, and
would allow no slackness in enforcing conformity. Archbishop
Grindal was sequestrated for defending &ldquo;prophesyings,&rdquo; or
meetings of the Puritan clergy for religious exercises. The House
of Commons, in which there was a Puritan element, repeatedly
attempted to discuss church questions and was sharply silenced
by the queen, who would not allow any interference in ecclesiastical
matters. Whitgift, who succeeded Grindal in 1583, though
kind-hearted, was strict in his administration of the law. Violent
attacks were made upon the bishops in the Martin Marprelate
tracts printed by a secret press; their author is unknown,
but some who were probably connected with them were executed
for publishing seditious libels. Whitgift&rsquo;s firmness met with
success. During the last years of the reign the movement
towards Presbyterianism was checked and nonconformity was
less prominent. The church regained a measure of orderliness
and vigour; its claims on allegiance were advocated by eminent
divines and expounded in the stately pages of Hooker. The
queen, who had so vigorously ordered ecclesiastical affairs, died
in 1603.</p>

<p>On the accession of James I. the Puritans expressed their
desire for ecclesiastical change in the Millenary Petition which
purported to come from 1000 clergy; their requests
were moderate, a sign of the success of Whitgift&rsquo;s
<span class="sidenote">The Puritan rebellion.</span>
policy, but some could not have been granted without
causing widespread dissatisfaction. At a conference
between divines of the two parties at Hampton Court in 1604,
James roughly decided against the Puritans. Some small
alterations were made in the prayer-book, and a new version
of the Bible was undertaken, which appeared in 1611 as the
&ldquo;authorized version.&rdquo; In 1604 convocation framed a code of
canons which received royal authorization. Refusal to obey
them was punished with deprivation, and, according to S. R.
Gardiner, about 300 clergy were deprived, though a 17th century
writer (Peter Heylyn) puts the number at 49 only, which W. H.
Frere (<i>History of the English Church, 1558-1625</i>, p. 321) thinks
more credible. Conformity could still be enforced, but before
long the Puritan party grew in strength partly from religious and
partly from political causes. They would not admit any authority
in religion that was not based on the scriptures; their opponents
maintained that the church had authority to ordain ceremonies
not contrary to the scriptures. In doctrine the Puritans remained
faithful to the Calvinism in which most Englishmen of
the day had been brought up; they called the high churchmen
Arminians, and asserted that they were inclined to Rome.
The Commons became increasingly Puritan; they were strongly
Protestant and demanded the enforcement of the laws against
recusants, who suffered much, specially after the Gunpowder
Plot of 1605, though they were sometimes shielded by the king.
The Commons regarded ecclesiastical jurisdiction with dislike,
specially the Court of High Commission, which had developed
from the ecclesiastical commissions of Elizabeth and was hated
as a means of coercion based on prerogative. The bishops
derived their support from the king, and the church in return
supported the king&rsquo;s claim to absolutism and divine right. It
suffered heavily from this alliance. As men saw the church on
the side of absolutism, Puritanism grew strong both among the
country gentry, who were largely represented in the Commons,
and among the nation at large, and the church lost ground
through the king&rsquo;s political errors. A restoration of order and
decency in worship and the introduction of more ceremonial
begun in James&rsquo;s reign were carried on by Laud (<i>q.v.</i>) under
Charles I. Laud aimed at silencing disputes about doctrine and
enforcing outward uniformity; the Puritans hated ceremonial
and wished to make every one accept their doctrines. Many
of the reforms introduced by Laud after he became archbishop
in 1633 were needful, but they offended the Puritans and were
enforced in a harsh and tyrannical manner, for he lacked wisdom
and sympathy. Under his rule nonconforming clergy were
deprived and sometimes imprisoned. The cruel punishments
inflicted by the Court of Star Chamber of which he was a member,
the unpopularity of the High Commission Court, his own harsh
dealing, and the part which he took in politics as a confidential
adviser of the king, combined to bring odium upon him and upon
the ecclesiastical system which he represented. The church was
weak, for the Laudian system was disliked by the nation. A
storm of discontent with the course of affairs both in church
and state gathered. In 1640 Charles, after dissolving parliament,
prolonged the session of convocation, which issued canons
magnifying the royal authority and imposing the so-called
&ldquo;<i>et cetera</i> oath&rdquo; against innovations on all clergy, graduates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page450" id="page450"></a>450</span>
and others. The Long Parliament voted the canons illegal;
Laud was imprisoned, and in 1642 the bishops were excluded
from parliament. The civil war began in 1642; in 1643 a bill
was passed for the taking away of episcopacy, in 1645 Laud
was beheaded, and parliament abolished the prayer-book and
accepted the Presbyterian directory, and from 1646 Presbyterianism
was the legal form of church government. Many, perhaps
2000, clergy were deprived; some were imprisoned and otherwise
maltreated, though a fifth of their former revenues was assigned
to the dispossessed. The king, who was beheaded in 1649, might
have extricated himself from his difficulties if he had consented
to the overthrow of episcopacy, and may therefore be held a
martyr to the church&rsquo;s cause. The victory of the army over the
parliament secured England against the tyranny of Presbyterianism,
but did not better the condition of the episcopal clergy;
the toleration insisted on by the Independents did not extend
to &ldquo;prelacy.&rdquo; Churchmen, however, occasionally enjoyed the
ministrations of their own clergy in private houses, and though
their worship was sometimes disturbed they were not seriously
persecuted for engaging in it. Non-delinquent or non-sequestrated
private patronage and the obligation of tithes were
retained. Community of suffering and the execution of Charles I.
brought the royalist country gentry into sympathy with the
clergy, and at the Restoration the church had the hold upon
the affection of the laity which it lacked under the Laudian rule.</p>

<p>On the king&rsquo;s restoration the survivors of the ejected clergy
quietly regained their benefices. The Presbyterians helped to
bring back the king and looked for a reward. Charles
II. promised them a limited episcopacy and other
<span class="sidenote">The Restoration period.</span>
concessions, but his plan was rejected by the Commons.
A conference at the Savoy between leading Presbyterians
and churchmen in 1661 was ineffectual, and a revision
of the prayer-book by convocation further discontented nonconformists.
The parliament of 1661 was violently anti-Puritan,
and in 1662 passed an Act of Uniformity providing that all
ministers not episcopally ordained or refusing to conform should
be deprived on St Bartholomew&rsquo;s day, the 14th of August
following. About 2000 ministers are said to have been ejected,
and in 1665 ejected ministers were forbidden to come within
five miles of their former cures. Though some bishops and
clergy showed kindness to the ejected, churchmen generally
approved of this oppressive legislation; they could not forget
the wrongs inflicted on their church by the once triumphant
Puritans. Nonconformist worship was made punishable by
fine and imprisonment, and on the third offence by transportation.
In 1672 Charles, who had secretly promised the French
king openly to profess Roman Catholicism, issued a Declaration
of Indulgence which applied both to Romanists and Protestant
Nonconformists, but parliament compelled him to withdraw
it, and, in 1673, passed a Test Act making reception of the holy
communion and a denial of transubstantiation necessary qualifications
for public office. Later, when the dissenters found
friends among the party in parliament opposed to the crown,
the church supported the king, and the doctrine of passive
obedience was generally accepted by the clergy. The church
was popular, and among the great preachers and theologians
who adorned it in the Caroline period were Jeremy Taylor,
Pearson, Bull, Barrow, South and Stillingfleet. The lower
clergy were mostly poor, and their social position was consequently
often humble, but the pictures of clerical humiliation
after 1660 are generally overcoloured; the assertion that they
commonly married servants or cast-off mistresses of their patrons
has been disproved, and it is certain that men of good family
entered holy orders. In accordance with an agreement between
Archbishop Sheldon and Lord Chancellor Clarendon, the clergy
ceased to tax themselves in convocation, and from 1665 have been
taxed by parliament. James II., though a Romanist, promised
to protect the church, and the clergy were on his side in the
rebellion of the duke of Monmouth, who was supported by
dissenters. The church and the nation, however, were strongly
Protestant and were soon alarmed by his efforts to Romanize
the country. James dispensed with the law by prerogative and
appointed Romanists to offices in defiance of the Test Act. In
1688 he ordered that his declaration for liberty of conscience,
issued in the interest of Romanism, should be read in all
churches. His order was almost universally disobeyed. Archbishop
Sancroft and six bishops who remonstrated against it
were brought to trial, and were acquitted to the extreme delight
of the nation. James&rsquo;s attack on the church cost him his crown.</p>

<p>Sancroft and eight bishops would not belie their belief in the
doctrines of divine right and passive obedience by swearing
allegiance to William and Mary, and the archbishop,
five bishops and over 400 clergy were deprived.
<span class="sidenote">Revolution period.</span>
Certain of these nonjuring bishops consecrated others
and a schism ensued. The loss to the church was heavy; for
among the nonjurors were many men of holy lives and eminent
learning, and the fact that some suffered for conscience&rsquo; sake
seemed a reproach on the rest of the clergy. After 1715 the
secession became unimportant. Protestantism was secured
from further royal attack by the Bill of Rights; and in 1701
the Act of Succession provided that all future sovereigns
should be members of the Church of England. That the king&rsquo;s
title rested on a parliamentary decision was destructive of the
clerical theory of divine right, and encouraged Erastianism,
then specially dangerous to the church; for William, a Dutch
Presbyterian, gave bishoprics to men personally worthy, but
more desirous of union with other Protestant bodies than jealous
for the principles of their own church. A bill for union was
rejected in the Commons, where the church party had a majority,
though one for toleration of Protestant dissenters became law.
William, anxious for concessions to dissenters, appointed a
committee of convocation for altering the liturgy, canons and
ecclesiastical courts, but the Tory party in the lower house of
convocation was strong and the scheme was abortive. A long
controversy began between the two houses: the bishops were
mostly Whigs with latitudinarian tendencies, the lower clergy
Tories and high churchmen. During most of the reign convocation
was suspended and the church was governed by royal
injunctions, a system injurious to its welfare. It had been the
bulwark of the nation against Romanism under James II., and
the affection of the nation enabled it to preserve its distinctive
character amid dangers of an opposite kind under William III.
Its religious life was active; associations for worship and the
reformation of manners led to more frequent services, the establishment
of schools for poor children, and the foundation of the
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (S.P.C.K.) and for
the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (S.P.G.). This
activity and the discord between the two houses of convocation
continued during Anne&rsquo;s reign. Anne was a strong church-woman,
and under her the church reached its highest point of
popularity and influence. Its supposed interests were used by
the Tories for political ends. Hence the Occasional Conformity
Act, to prevent evasion of the Test Act, and a tyrannical Schism
Act, both repealed in 1718, belong rather to the history of
parties than to that of the church. So, too, does the case of Dr
Sacheverell, who was prosecuted for a violently Tory sermon.
His trial, in 1710, caused much excitement; mobs shouted for
&ldquo;High Church and Dr Sacheverell,&rdquo; and the lightness of his
sentence was hailed as a Tory victory. Queen Anne is gratefully
remembered by the church for her &ldquo;Bounty,&rdquo; which gave it
the first-fruits and tenths (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Annates</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Queen Anne&rsquo;s
Bounty</a></span>).</p>

<p>With the accession of the Hanoverian line the church entered
on a period of feeble life and inaction: many church fabrics
were neglected; daily services were discontinued;
holy days were disregarded; Holy Communion was
<span class="sidenote">The 18th century.</span>
infrequent; the poor were little cared for; and though
the church remained popular, the clergy were lazy and held in
contempt. In accepting the settlement of the crown the clergy
generally sacrificed conviction to expediency, and their character
suffered. Promotion largely depended on a profession of Whig
principles: the church was regarded as subservient to the
state; its historic position and claims were ignored, and it was
treated by politicians as though its principal function was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page451" id="page451"></a>451</span>
support the government. This change was accelerated by the
silencing of convocation. A sermon by Hoadly, bishop of Bangor,
impugned the existence of a visible church, and the &ldquo;Bangorian
controversy&rdquo; which ensued threatened to end in the condemnation
of his opinions by convocation, or at least by the lower
house. As this would have weakened the government, convocation
was prorogued, letters of business were withheld, and from
1717 until 1852 convocation, the church&rsquo;s constitutional organ
of reform, existed only in name. Walpole during his long
ministry, from 1721 to 1742, discouraged activity in the church
lest it should become troublesome to his government. Preferment
was shamelessly sought after even by pious men, and was
begged and bestowed on the ground of political services. In
this the clergy, apart from the sacredness of clerical office, were
neither better nor worse than the laity; in morality and decency
they were better even at the lowest point of their decline, about
the middle of the century. While the church was inactive in
practical work, it showed vigour in the intellectual defence of
Christianity. Controversies of earlier origin with assailants of
the faith were ably maintained by, among others, Daniel
Waterland, William Law, a nonjuror, Bishop Butler, whose
<i>Analogy</i> appeared in 1736, and Bishop Berkeley. A revival of
spirituality and energy at last set in. Its origin has been traced
to Law&rsquo;s Serious Call, published in 1728. Law&rsquo;s teaching was
actively carried out by John Wesley (<i>q.v.</i>), a clergyman who from
1739 devoted himself to evangelization. Though his preaching
awoke much religious feeling, specially among the lower classes,
the excitement which attended it led to a horror of religious
enthusiasm, and his methods irritated the parochial clergy.
Some of them seconded his efforts, but far more regarded them
with violent and often unworthily expressed dislike. While he
urged his followers to adhere to the church, he could not himself
work in subordination to discipline; the Methodist organization
which he founded was independent of the church&rsquo;s system and
soon drifted into separation. Nevertheless, he did much to bring
about a revival of life in the church. Several clergy became
his allies, and some preached in Lady Huntingdon&rsquo;s chapels
before her secession. These were among the fathers of the
Evangelical party: they differed from the Methodists in not
forming an organization, remaining in the church, working on
the parochial system, and generally holding Calvinistic doctrine,
being so far nearer to Whitfield than to Wesley, though Calvinism
gradually ceased to be a mark of the party. The Evangelicals
soon grew in number, and their influence for good was extensive.
They laid stress on the depravity of human nature, and on the
importance of conscious conversion, giving prominence to the
necessity of personal salvation rather than of incorporation with,
and abiding in, the church of the redeemed. Prominent among
their early leaders after they became distinct from the Methodists
were William Romaine, Henry Venn and John Newton.
Bishop Porteus of London sympathized with them, Lord Dartmouth
was a liberal patron, and Cowper&rsquo;s poetry spread their
doctrines in quarters where sermons might have failed to attract.
Religion was also forwarded in the church by the example of
George III. During his reign the progress of toleration, though
slow and fitful, greatly advanced both as regards Roman Catholics
and Protestant dissenters. The spirit of rationalism, which
had been manifested earlier in attacks on revelation, appeared
in a movement against subscription to the Articles demanded
of the clergy and others which was defeated in parliament in
1772. The alarm consequent on the French Revolution checked
the progress of toleration and was temporarily fatal to free-thinking;
it strengthened the position of the church, which
was regarded as a bulwark of society against the spread of
revolutionary doctrines; and this caused the Evangelicals to
draw off more completely from the Methodists. The church
was active: the Sunday-school movement, begun in 1780,
flourished; the crusade against the slave-trade was vigorously
supported by Evangelicals; and the Church Missionary Society
(C.M.S.), a distinctly Evangelical organization, was founded.
Excellent as were the results of the revival generally, the
Evangelicals had defects which tended to weaken the church.
Some characteristics of their teaching were repellent to the
young; they were deficient in theological learning, and often
in learning of any kind; they took a low view of the church,
regarding it as the offspring of the Protestant reformation;
they expounded the Bible without reference to the church&rsquo;s
teaching, and paid little heed to the church&rsquo;s directions. Dissent
consequently grew stronger. By the Act of Union with Ireland
the Churches of England and Ireland were united from the
1st of January 1801, and the continuance of the united church
was declared an essential part of the union. No provision,
however, was made giving the Irish clergy a place in convocation,
which was evidently held unlikely to revive. The union of the
churches was dissolved in 1871 by an act of 1869 for disestablishing
the Irish Church.</p>

<p>Apart from the Evangelical revival, religion was advanced
in the church. In 1811 the education of the poor was provided
for on church principles by the National Society; the
Church Building Society was founded in 1818; and the
<span class="sidenote">The Oxford Movement.</span>
colonial episcopate was started by the establishment
of bishoprics in Calcutta in 1814, and in Jamaica and Barbados in
1824. Yet reforms were urgently needed. In 1813, out of about
10,800 benefices, 6311 are said to have been without resident incumbents
(<i>The Black Book</i>, p. 34); the value of some great offices
was enormous, while many of the parochial clergy were wretchedly
poor. The repeal of the Test Act, long practically inoperative,
in 1828, and Catholic emancipation in 1829, mark a change in
the relations of church and state; and the Reform Bill of 1832
transferred political power from a class which generally supported
the church to classes in which dissent was strong. The national
zeal for reform was directed towards the church, not always in
a friendly spirit. Yet wholesome changes were effected by
legislation: dioceses were rearranged and two new bishoprics
founded at Manchester and Ripon, the bishopric of Bristol,
however, being suppressed; plurality and non-residence were
abolished; tithes were commuted, and the Ecclesiastical Commission,
which has effected reforms in respect of endowments,
was permanently established in 1836. Some changes and proposals
alarmed churchmen, specially as legislation for the church
proceeded from parliament, while convocation remained silenced.
Latitudinarian opinions revived, and the church was regarded
merely as a human institution. Among the clergy generally
ritual observance was neglected and rubrical directions disobeyed.
A few churchmen, including Keble and Newman, set themselves
to revive church feeling, and Oxford became the centre of a new
movement. The publication of Keble&rsquo;s <i>Christian Year</i> prepared
its way, and its aims were declared in his assize sermon at Oxford
on &ldquo;National Apostasy&rdquo; in 1833. Its promoters urged their
views in <i>Tracts for the Times</i>, and were strengthened by the
adhesion of Pusey. Hence they were nicknamed Tractarians
or Puseyites. Their cardinal doctrine was that the Church of
England was a part of the visible Holy Catholic Church and had
unbroken connexion with the primitive church; they inculcated
high views of the sacraments, and emphasized points of agreement
with those branches of the Catholic Church which claim
apostolic succession. Their party grew in spite of the opposition
of low and broad churchmen, who, specially on the publication
of Tract XC. by Newman in 1841, declared that its teaching
was Romanizing. In 1845 Newman and several others seceded
to Rome. Newman&rsquo;s apostasy was a severe blow to the church,
though permanent injury was averted by the steadfastness of
Pusey. The Oxford movement was wrecked, but its effect
survived both in the new high church party and in the church
at large. As a body the clergy rated more highly the responsibilities
and dignity of their profession, and became more zealous
in the performance of its duties and more ecclesiastically minded.
High churchmen carried out rubrical directions, and after a while
began to introduce changes into the performance of divine
service which had not been adopted by the early leaders of the
party, were deprecated by many bishops, and excited opposition.</p>

<p>In 1833 the supreme jurisdiction of the Court of Delegates
was transferred to the judicial committee of the privy council.
Before this court came an appeal by a clerk named Gorham,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page452" id="page452"></a>452</span>
whom the bishop of Exeter refused to institute to a benefice
<span class="sidenote">The church and the law courts.</span>
because he denied unconditional regeneration in baptism, and in
1850 the court decided in the appellant&rsquo;s favour. The
decision was followed by some secessions to Rome,
and high churchmen were dissatisfied that spiritual
questions should be decided by a secular court.
The &ldquo;papal aggression&rdquo; of that year, by which Pius IX.
appeared to claim authority in England, roused violent popular
indignation which was used against the high church party.
However, it afforded an argument for the revival of convocation,
and, chiefly owing to the exertions of Bishop Wilberforce of
Oxford, convocation again met in 1852 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Convocation</a></span>).
Meanwhile broad church opinions were gaining ground to some
extent owing to a reaction from the Oxford movement. Among
the clergy the broad church party was comparatively small,
but it included some men of mark. In 1860 appeared <i>Essays
and Reviews</i>, a volume of essays by seven authors, of whom
six were in orders. The book as a whole had a rationalistic
tendency and was condemned by convocation: two of the
essayists were suspended by the Court of Arches, but its judgment
was reversed by the judicial committee. Crude attacks on the
authority of the Scriptures and the position of the English
Church with respect to it having been published by Colenso,
bishop of Natal, he was deposed by his metropolitan, Bishop
Gray of Cape Town, in 1863, but the judicial committee decided
that the bishop of Cape Town had no coercive jurisdiction over
Natal. Convocation declared Colenso&rsquo;s books erroneous, abstaining
in face of this judgment from acknowledging as valid the
excommunication which Bishop Gray pronounced against him.
It followed from the decision of the council that the English
Church in a self-governing colony is a voluntary association.
Opposition to the dogmatic principle in the church was maintained.
Some practices introduced by clergy desirous of bringing
the services of the church to a higher level came before the judicial
committee in the case of <i>Westerton</i> v. <i>Liddell</i> in 1857, with a
result encouraging to the ritualists, as they then began to be
called. An increase in ritual usages, such as eucharistic vestments,
altar lights and incense, followed. In 1859-1860 disgraceful
riots took place at St George&rsquo;s-in-the-East, London,
where an advanced ritual was used. In 1860 the English
Church Union was formed mainly to uphold high church doctrine
and ritual, and assist clergy prosecuted for either cause, and in
1865 the Church Association, mainly to put down such doctrine
and ritual by prosecution. A royal commission appointed
in 1867 recommended that facilities should be granted for enabling
parishioners aggrieved by ritual to gain redress, and in
1870 that a revised lectionary and a shortened form of service
should be provided. A new lectionary was approved by the
two convocations and enacted, and convocation having received
letters of business in 1872 and 1874 drew up a shortened form
of prayer which was also enacted, but the commission had no
further direct results. Between 1867 and 1871 two decisions
of the judicial committee were adverse to the ritualists,
and by exciting dislike to the court among high churchmen
indirectly led to an increase in ritual usages. Among those
who adopted them were many self-devoted men; their practices,
which they believed to be incumbent on them, were condemned
as illegal, yet they saw the rubrics daily disregarded with
impunity by others who trod the easy path of neglect. In 1873
a declaration against sacramental confession received the assent
of the bishops, and in 1874 Archbishop Tait of Canterbury
introduced a bill for enforcing the law on the ritualist clergy;
it was transformed in committee, and was enacted as the Public
Worship Regulation Act. It provided for the appointment
of a new judge in place of the old ecclesiastical judges, the
officials principal, of the two provinces. Litigation increased,
the only check on prosecutions being the right of the bishop to
veto proceedings, and in 1878-1881 four clergymen were imprisoned
for disobedience to the orders of courts against whose
jurisdiction they protested. In consequence of the scandal
raised by this mode of dealing with spiritual causes, a royal
commission on ecclesiastical courts was appointed in 1881, but
its report in 1883 led to no results, and the bishops strove to
mend matters by exercising their veto. Advanced and illegal
usages became more frequent. Proceedings in respect of
illegal ritual having been instituted against Bishop King of
Lincoln, the archbishop of Canterbury (Benson) personally
heard and decided the case in 1890, and his judgment was upheld
by the judicial committee (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lincoln Judgment</a></span>). The
spiritual character of the tribunal and the authority of the judgment
which sanctioned certain usages and condemned others,
had a quieting effect. Increase in ritualism, however, caused
agitation in 1898, and in 1899 and 1900 the two archbishops,
Temple of Canterbury and Maclagan of York, delivered
&ldquo;opinions&rdquo; condemning the use of incense and processional
lights, and the reservation of the consecrated elements. Finding
himself unable to put down illegal practices, Bishop Creighton
of London adopted a policy of compromise which was followed
by other bishops, and encouraged illegality. Disregard of law
both in excess and defect of ritual being common, a royal
commission on ecclesiastical discipline was appointed in 1904.
The commissioners presented a unanimous report in 1906, its
chief recommendations being, briefly, that practices significant
of doctrines repugnant to those of the English Church should be
extirpated; that the convocations should prepare a new ornaments
rubric, and frame modifications in the conduct of divine
service; that the diocesan and provincial courts and the court
of final appeal should be reformed in accordance with the
recommendations of 1883, the last to consist of a permanent
body of lay judges who on all doubtful questions touching the
doctrine or use of the church should be bound by the decision
of an episcopal assembly; that the Public Worship Regulation
Act should be repealed, and the bishops&rsquo; power of veto
abolished.</p>

<p>Since the Oxford movement the church has developed
wonderful energy. Yet it is beset with difficulties and dangers
both from within and without. Within, besides
difficulties as regards ritual, it has to contend against
<span class="sidenote">Present life.</span>
rationalism, which has been stimulated by scientific
discoveries and speculations, and far more by Biblical criticism.
While this criticism has been used by many as a means to a fuller
comprehension of divine revelation, much of it is simply destructive,
and has led to ill-considered expressions of opinion
adverse to the doctrine of the church. From without, the church
has been threatened with disestablishment both wholly and as
regards the dioceses within the Welsh counties; and the education
of the poor, which from early days depended on its care, has
largely been taken out of its hands (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Education</a></span>). The amount
contributed by the church to elementary education, including the
maintenance of Sunday schools, in 1907-8 was £576,012. During
the last sixty years the church has strengthened its hold on the
loyalty of the nation by its increased efficiency. Its bishops are
laborious and active. Since 1876 the home episcopate has been
increased by the creation of the dioceses of Truro, St Albans,
Liverpool, Newcastle, Southwell, Wakefield, Bristol, Southwark
and Birmingham, so that there are now (1910) thirty-seven
diocesan bishops, aided by twenty-eight suffragan and eight
assistant bishops, and a further subdivision of dioceses is contemplated.
At no other time probably have the clergy been so
industrious. As a rule they are far better instructed in theology
than forty years ago, but they have not advanced in secular
learning. Changes in the university system have contributed to
draw off able young men to other professions which offer greater
worldly advantages. The poverty of many of the clergy stands in
strong contrast to the wealth around them. Of 14,242 benefices
4704 are said to be below £200 a year net value. The value of
£100 tithe rent charge has sunk (1909) to £69: 18 : 5¼, the
average value since the Commutation Act of 1836 being
£94 : 3 : 2¾. The number of assistant clergy is (1910) about 7500,
in spite of the hardships often attending clerical life, the supply
of men being kept up. The Queen Victoria Clergy Fund and
other voluntary associations and various educational institutions
have been founded to relieve clerical distress. In the church at
home there is much energy in numberless directions: cathedral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page453" id="page453"></a>453</span>
churches have become centres of religious activity, and in parish
churches the administration of the Holy Communion and weekday
services are frequent. Many of the laity co-operate in
church work and liberally support it. During the years 1898-1907
598 churches were built or rebuilt, and during twenty-four
years, 1884-1907, the voluntary offerings for church building were
£27,612,709, and for endowments and parsonages £6,116,592, yet
church extension fails to keep pace with the increase of the
population. Evangelistic efforts, the relief of the sick and poor,
and the inculcation of temperance are zealously carried on.
Good work is done by twenty-six sisterhoods and several institutions
of deaconesses, and one or two communities of celibate
clergy. In the British colonies and India the episcopate consists
(1909) of seven archbishops with two coadjutors; there are
also seventy diocesan bishops, and in other parts of the world
thirty missionary bishops. The S.P.G. has 847 ordained ministers,
including thirty chaplains in Europe, besides many female
missionaries; the C.M.S. has 793 ordained ministers, and many
other missionaries of both sexes; the Zenana Missionary Society
has a staff of 1288; other church societies for foreign missions are
vigorous, and the S.P.C.K. in addition to its work at home spends
large sums in furthering the church abroad. The benefits arising
from conference have increasingly been valued since the revival
of convocation. Appreciation of the importance of lay support
and counsel has led to the institution of two voluntary elective
assemblies called Houses of Laymen, one for each province, and in
1905 an association of the four houses of convocation and the two
lay assemblies was formed with the name of the Representative
Church Council. During the last forty years diocesan conferences,
in which the laity are represented, have become universal,
while ruridecanal and other meetings of a like kind are general.
An annual church congress, established in 1861, held its forty-ninth
meeting in 1909. Of wider importance are the Lambeth
conferences, held since 1878 at intervals of ten years, to which the
bishops of the English Church and the churches in communion
with it are invited, and meet under the presidency of the archbishop
of Canterbury. The first of these conferences, which
illustrate the dignity of the see founded by St Augustine and now
the head of a vast quasi-patriarchate, was held under the
presidency of Archbishop Longley in 1867 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lambeth Conferences</a></span>
and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Anglican Communion</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">ENGLEFIELD, SIR FRANCIS<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> (c. 1520-1596), English Roman
Catholic politician, born probably about 1520, was the eldest son
of Sir Thomas Englefield of Englefield, Berkshire, justice of the
common pleas. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Sir
Robert Throckmorton, one of the well-known Catholic family of
Coughton, Warwickshire. Francis, who succeeded his father in
1537, was too young to have taken any part in the opposition to
the abolition of the Roman jurisdiction and dissolution of the
monasteries; and he acquiesced in these measures to the extent
of taking the oath of royal supremacy, serving as sheriff of
Berkshire and Oxfordshire in 1546-1547, and accepting in 1545 a
grant of the manor of Tilehurst, which had belonged to Reading
Abbey. He was even knighted at the coronation of Edward VI.
in February 1547. But the progress of the Reformation during
that reign alienated him, and he attached his fortunes to the
cause of the princess Mary, whose service he entered before
1551. In August of that year he was sent to the Tower for
permitting Mass to be celebrated in Mary&rsquo;s household. He was
released in the following March, and permitted to resume his
duties in Mary&rsquo;s service. But in February 1553 he was again
summoned before the privy council, and may have been in
confinement at the crisis of July; perhaps he was only released
on Mary&rsquo;s triumph, for his name does not appear among those
who exerted themselves on her behalf before the middle of
August. He was then sworn a member of the privy council like
many others who owed their promotion to their loyalty rather
than to their political abilities. Their numbers swelled the privy
council and sadly impaired its efficiency; but Mary resisted the
various attempts to get rid of them because she liked staunch
friends, and regarded them as a salutary check upon the abler but
less scrupulous members who had served Edward VI. as well as
herself. Englefield sat as M.P. for Berkshire in all Mary&rsquo;s
parliaments except that of April 1554, but received no higher
political office than the lucrative mastership of the court of
wards.</p>

<p>He was an ardent believer in persecution, was present at
Hooper&rsquo;s trial, sought Ascham&rsquo;s ruin, and naturally lost his office
and his seat on the privy council at Elizabeth&rsquo;s succession. He
retired to the continent before May 1559, and from that time
until his death was an active participant in all schemes for the
restoration of Roman Catholicism. At first his ideas took such
comparatively mild forms as inducing the pope to send a legate to
persuade Elizabeth to return to the fold; but gradually they
grew more violent and treasonable, until Englefield became the
close confidant of Cardinal Allen, Parsons and the &ldquo;jesuited&rdquo;
Catholics, who advocated forcible intervention by Spain and the
succession of the infanta; in 1585 Englefield thought that Mary&rsquo;s
succession, peaceful or other, would not be satisfactory unless it
were owing to Spanish support and she were dependent on
Philip. Englefield lived first at Rome, then in the Low Countries,
and finally at Valladolid. He was blind for the last twenty years
of his life, and received a pension of six hundred crowns from
Philip. He had been outlawed in 1564 and his estates sequestered,
but they were not forfeited until 1585, when an act of attainder
was passed against Englefield. Even then some legal difficulties
stood in the way of their appropriation by the crown, for Englefield,
obviously with an eye to this contingency, had conditionally
settled them on his nephew Francis. The long arguments on the
point are given in Coke&rsquo;s <i>Reports</i>, and a further act was passed
in 1592 confirming the forfeiture to the crown. The nephew,
however, eventually recovered some of the family estates, and was
created a baronet in 1612. His uncle was alive in September
1596, but apparently died at Valladolid about the end of that
year. His tomb there used to be shown to visitors as that of an
eminent man.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ENGLEHEART, GEORGE<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> (1752-1829), English miniature
painter, the great rival of Richard Cosway, was born at Kew in
October 1752, and received his artistic training first under George
Barret, R.A., and then under Sir Joshua Reynolds. He started
on his own account in 1773, and exhibited in that year at the
Royal Academy. He continued the active pursuit of his profession
down to 1813, when he retired, and his fee-book, still
in existence, records the names of his sitters, and the amount
paid for each portrait, proving that he painted 4853 miniatures
during that period of thirty-nine years, and that his professional
income for many years exceeded £1200 a year. During the
greater part of his life he resided in Hertford Street, Mayfair,
where he lived till he retired. He died at Blackheath in 1829,
and was buried at Kew.</p>

<p>He painted George III. twenty-five times, and had a very
extensive circle of patrons, comprising nearly all the important
persons connected with the court. He made careful copies in
miniature of many of the famous paintings executed by Sir
Joshua Reynolds, and in some cases these constitute the only
information we possess respecting portraits by Sir Joshua
that are now missing. His fee-book, colours, appliances and a
large collection of his miniatures still remain in the possession
of his descendants.</p>

<p>His nephew, <span class="sc">John Cox Dillman Engleheart</span> (1784-1862),
also a miniature painter, entered George Engleheart&rsquo;s studio
when he was but fourteen years of age. He first exhibited at
the Royal Academy in 1801, and sent in altogether 157 works.
He was a man of substantial means, and in his time a very
popular painter, but his health broke down when he was forty-four
years old, and he had to relinquish the pursuit of his profession.
He lived at Tunbridge Wells for some years and died
there in 1862.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ENGLEWOOD,<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> a city of Bergen county, New Jersey, U.S.A.,
near the Hudson river, 14 m. N. by E. of Jersey City. Pop.
(1900) 6253, of whom 1548 were foreign-born and 386 negroes;
(1905) 7922; (1910) 9924. It is served by a branch of the Erie
railway, and by an electric line connecting with a ferry (at Fort
Lee) to New York. Englewood is primarily a residential suburb
of New York. The site rises terrace above terrace from the
marshes in the valley of the Hackensack to the top of the palisades
overlooking the Hudson, from which Englewood is separated by
the borough of Englewood Cliffs (pop. in 1905, 266). There are
several fine residences, a hospital, a public library and the
Dwight school for girls (1859). The site of Englewood was for
a long time a part of &ldquo;English Neighbourhood,&rdquo; and was known
as Liberty Pole; but until 1859, when the place was laid out,
there were only a few houses here, one of which was the &ldquo;Liberty
Pole Tavern.&rdquo; In 1871 Englewood was set off from the township
of Hackensack and was incorporated as a separate township,
and in 1896 it was chartered as a city; but the act under which
it was chartered was declared unconstitutional, and in 1899
Englewood was rechartered as a city by a special act of the state
legislature.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ENGLISH CHANNEL<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> (commonly called &ldquo;The Channel&rdquo;;
Fr. <i>La Manche</i>, &ldquo;the sleeve&rdquo;), the narrow sea separating
England from France. If its entrance be taken to lie between
Ushant and the Scilly Isles, its extreme breadth (between those
points) is about 100 m., and its length about 350. At the Strait
of Dover, its breadth decreases to 20 m. Along both coasts of the
Channel, cliffs and lowland alternate, and the geological affinities
between successive opposite stretches are well marked, as between
the Devonian and granitic rocks of Cornwall and Brittany, the
Jurassic of Portland and Calvados, and the Cretaceous of the
Pays de Caux and the Isle of Wight and the Sussex coast, as well
as either shore of the Strait of Dover. The English Channel is
of comparatively recent geological formation. The land-connexion
between England and the continent was not finally
severed until the latter part of the Pleistocene period. The
Channel covers what was previously a wide valley, and may be
described now as a headless gulf. The action of waves and
currents, both destructive and constructive, is well seen at
many points; thus Shakespeare Cliff at Dover is said to have
been cut back more than a mile during the Christian era, and the
cliffs of Grisnez have similarly receded. Of the opposite process
notable examples are the building of the pebbly beaches of
Chesil Bank and near Tréguier in Côtes du Nord, and the promontory
of Dungeness. The total drainage area of the English
rivers flowing into the Channel is about 8000 sq. m.; of the
French rivers, including as they do the Seine, it is about 41,000
sq. m.</p>

<p>From the Strait of Dover the bottom slopes fairly regularly
down to the western entrance of the Channel, the average depths
ranging from 20 to 30 fathoms in the Strait to 60 fathoms at the
entrance. An exception to this condition, however, is found in
Hurd&rsquo;s Deep, a narrow depression about 70 m. long, lying north
and north-west of the Channel Islands, and at its nearest point
to them only 5 m. distant from their outlying rocks, the Casquets.
Towards its eastern end Hurd&rsquo;s Deep has an extreme depth of
94 fathoms, and in it are found steeper slopes from shoal to deep
water than elsewhere within the Channel. Nearing the entrance
to the Channel from the Atlantic, the 100 fathoms line may be
taken to mark the edge of soundings. Beyond this depth the
bottom falls away rapidly. The 100 fathoms line is laid down
about 180 m. W. to 120 m. S.W. of the Scilly Isles, and 80 m.
W. of Ushant. Within it there are considerable irregularities
of the bottom; thus a succession of narrow ridges running N.E.
and S.W. occurs west of the Scillies, while only 4 m. N.W. of
Ushant there is a small depression in which a depth of 105 fathoms
has been found. As a general rule the slope from the English
coast to the deepest parts of the Channel is more regular than
that from the French coast, and for that reason, and in consideration
of the greater dangers to navigation towards the French
shore, the fairway is taken to lie between 12 and 24 m. from the
principal promontories of the English shore, as far up-channel as
Beachy Head. These promontories (the Lizard, Start Point,
Portland Bill, St Alban&rsquo;s Head, St Catherine&rsquo;s Point of the Isle
of Wight, Selsey Bill, Beachy Head, Dungeness, the South
Foreland) demarcate a series of bays roughly of sickle-shape, the
shores of which run north and south, or nearly so, at their
western sides, turn eastward somewhat abruptly at their heads,
and then trend more gently towards the south-east. On the
French coast the arrangement is similar but reversed; Capes
Grisnez, Antifer and La Hague, and the Pointe du Sillon demarcating
a series of bays (larger than those on the English coast)
whose shores run north and south on the eastern side, and have
a gentler trend westward from the head.</p>

<p>The configuration of the coasts is perhaps the chief cause of
the peculiarities of tides in the Channel. From the entrance as
far as Portland Bill the time of high water is found to be progressively
later in passing from west to east, being influenced
by the oceanic tidal stream from the west under conditions which
are on the whole normal. But eastward of a line between
Portland Bill and the Gulf of St Malo these conditions are changed
and great irregularities are observed. On the English coast
between Portland Bill and Selsey a double tide is found. At
Portland this double tide corresponds approximately with the
time of low water in the regular tidal progression, and the result
is the occurrence of two periods of low water, separated by a
slight rise known locally as &ldquo;gulder.&rdquo; But farther east the
double tide corresponds more nearly with the time of high
water, and in consequence either the effect is produced of a
prolonged period of high water, or there are actually two periods
of high water, as at Southampton. Various causes apparently
contribute to this phenomenon. The configuration of the coast
line is such as to present at intervals barriers to the regular
movement of the tidal wave (west to east), so that reflex waves
(east to west) are set up. In the extreme case at Southampton
the tidal effect is carried from the outer Channel first by way of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page456" id="page456"></a>456</span>
the Solent, the strait west of the Isle of Wight, and later by way
of Spithead, the eastern strait. Finally the effect of the tidal
stream entering the Channel through the Strait of Dover from
the North Sea must be considered. The set of this stream
towards the Strait of Dover from the east corresponds in time
with that of the Channel stream (<i>i.e.</i> the stream within an area
defined by Start Point, the Casquets, Beachy Head and the mouth
of the Somme) towards the strait from the west; the set of the
two streams away from the strait also corresponds, and consequently
they alternately meet and separate. The area in which
the meeting and separation take place lies between Beachy
Head and the North Foreland, the mouth of the Somme and
Dunkirk. Within this area, therefore, a stream is formed,
known as the intermediate stream, which, running at first with
the Channel stream and then with the North Sea stream, changes
its direction throughout its length almost simultaneously,
and is never slack. Under these conditions, the time of high
water eastward of Selsey Bill as far as Dover is almost the same
at all points, though somewhat earlier at the east than at the
west of this stretch of coast. The configuration of the French
coast causes a very strong tidal flow in the Gulf of St Malo, with
an extreme range at spring tides of 42 ft. at St Germain, compared
with a range of 12 ft. at Exmouth and 7 ft. at Portland.
In the neighbourhood of Beer Head and Portland and Weymouth
Roads the streams are found to form vortices with only a slight
movement. On the eastern (Selsey-Dover) section of the English
coast the <i>maximum</i> range of tide is found at Hastings, with a
decrease both eastward and westward of this point.</p>

<p>Westerly winds are most prevalent in the Channel. The total
number of gales recorded in the period 1871-1885 was 190, of
which 104 were south-westerly. Gales are most frequent from
October to January (November during the above period had more
than any other month, with an average of 2.1), and most rare
from May to July. It appears that gales are generally more
violent and prolonged when coincident with spring tides than
with neaps. The winds have naturally a powerful effect on the
tidal streams and currents, the latter being in these seas simply
movements of the water set up by gales, which may themselves be
far distant. Thus under the influence of westerly winds prevailing
west of the Iberian Peninsula a current may be set up from the
Bay of Biscay across the entrance of the Channel; this is called
Rennell&rsquo;s current. Fogs and thick weather are common in the
Channel, and occur at all seasons of the year. Observations
during the period 1876-1890 at Dover, Hurst Castle and the
Scilly Isles showed that at the two first stations fogs most
frequently accompany anticyclonic conditions in winter, but at
the Scilly Isles they are much more common in summer than
in winter, and accompany winds of moderate strength more
frequently than in the case of the up-Channel stations.</p>
<div class="author">(O. J. R. H.)</div>

<p><i>Salinity and Temperature.</i>&mdash;The waters of the English Channel
are derived partly from the west and partly from the English and
French rivers, and all observations tend to show that there is a
slow and almost continuous current through it from west to east.
The western supply comes from two sources, one of which, the
more important, is the relatively salt and warm water of the Bay
of Biscay, which enters from the south-west and has a salinity
sometimes reaching 35.6 pro mille (parts of salt per thousand by
weight); the other consists of a southerly current from the Irish
Channel, and is colder and has a salinity of 35.0 to 35.2 pro mille.
As the water passes eastwards it mixes with the fresher coastal
water, so that the salinities generally rise from the shore to the
central line, and from east to west, though south of Scilly Islands
there is often a fall due to the influence of the Irish Channel.
The mean annual salinity decreases from between 35.4 and 35.5
pro mille in the western entrance to 35.2 pro mille at the Strait of
Dover on the central axis, and to about 34.7 pro mille under the
Isle of Wight and off the Bay of the Seine. The English Channel
may be divided into two areas by a line drawn from Start Point to
Guernsey and the Gulf of St Malo. In the eastern area the water
is thoroughly mixed owing to the action of the strong tidal
currents and its comparatively small depth, and salinities and
temperatures are therefore generally the same from surface to
bottom; while westward of this line there is often a strongly
marked division into layers of different salinity and temperature,
especially in summer and autumn, when the fresher water of
the Irish Channel is found overlying the salt water of the Bay
of Biscay. The salinity of the English Channel undergoes an
annual change, being highest in winter and spring and lowest in
summer, and this change is better marked in the eastern area,
where the mean deviation from the annual mean reaches 0.3 pro
mille, than it is farther west with a mean deviation of 0.1 pro
mille. There is also reason to believe that there is a regular
change with a two-year period, years of high maximum and low
minimum alternating with years of low maximum and high
minimum. Variations of long period or unperiodic also occur,
which are probably, and in one case (1905) almost certainly, due to
changes taking place some months earlier far out in the Atlantic
Ocean.</p>

<p>The mean annual <i>surface</i> temperature increases from between
11° C. and 11.5° C. at the Strait of Dover to over 12° C. at the
western entrance.<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The yearly range in the eastern area is
considerable, reaching 11° C. off the Isle of Wight and 10° C.
in the Strait of Dover; westward it gradually decreases to 5° C.
a short distance north-west of Ushant. The mean maximum
temperature, over 16° C., is found under the English coast from
Start Point to the Strait of Dover about the 1st of September
and off the French coast eastward of Cape la Hague about
eleven days later. In the western area the maximum temperature
is about 15° C. and occurs between September 1 and 11.
The mean minimum surface temperature is between 5° C. and
6° C. at the eastern end, and increases to over 9° C. off the coast of
Brittany. Owing to the thorough mixing of the water in the
eastern area the temperatures are here generally the same at all
depths, and the description of the surface conditions applies
equally to the bottom. In the western entrance, on the other
hand, the bottom temperature is often much lower than on the
surface; the range here is also much less, about 3° C., and the
maximum is not reached till about the 1st of October, or from
three weeks to a month later than on the surface.</p>

<p>A detailed account of the mean conditions in the English Channel
will be found in <i>Rap. et procès-verbaux</i>, vol. vi., and <i>Bulletin supplémentaire</i>

<p><i>Cross-Channel Communication.</i>&mdash;An immense amount of time
and thought has been expended in the elaboration of schemes
to provide unbroken railway communication between Great
Britain and the continent of Europe and enable passengers and
goods to be conveyed across the Channel without the delay and
expense involved by transhipping them into and out of ordinary
steamers. These schemes have taken three main forms: (1)
tunnels, either made through the ground under the sea, or
consisting of built-up structures resting upon the sea bed; (2)
bridges, either elevated high above the sea-level so as to admit of
the unimpeded passage of ships under them, or submerged below
the surface; and (3) train ferries, or vessels capable of conveying
a train of railway vehicles with their loads. A tunnel was first
proposed at the very beginning of the 19th century by a French
mining engineer named Mathieu, whose scheme was for a time
favourably regarded by Napoleon, but it was first put on a
practical basis more than fifty years later by J. A. Thomé
de Gamond (1807-1876), whose plans were submitted to the
French emperor in 1856. This engineer had begun to work
at the problem of cross-Channel communication twenty years
previously, and had considered the possibility of a submerged
tunnel or tube resting on the sea-level, of steam ferries plying
between huge piers thrown out from both coasts, and of a bridge,
for which he prepared five different plans. He again brought
forward his scheme for a tunnel, in a modified form, in 1867, and
exhibited his plans in the Universal Exhibition of that year.
About the same time an English engineer, William Lowe, of
Wrexham, was also working at the idea of a tunnel. Geological
investigation convinced him that between Fanhole, a point half a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page457" id="page457"></a>457</span>
mile west of the South Foreland light, and Sangatte on the
French coast, 4 m. W. of Calais, the Dover grey chalk was
continuous from side to side, and he considered that this stratum,
owing to its comparative freedom from water and the general
absence of cracks and fissures, offered exceptional advantages for
a tunnel. He and Thomé de Gamond joined forces, and their
plans were adopted by an international committee whose object
was to popularize the idea of a tunnel both in England and France.
Its engineers on the English side were Lowe, Sir James Brunlees
and Sir John Hawkshaw, the last of whom in 1866 had made
trial borings at St Margaret&rsquo;s and near Sangatte; and on the
French side Thomé de Gamond, Paulin Talabot and Michael
Chevalier. In 1868 they reported that there was a reasonable
prospect of completing the tunnel in ten or twelve years at a cost
not exceeding ten millions sterling. They admitted, however,
that there was some risk of an influx of the sea, but pointed out
that this risk could be determined by driving preliminary
driftways, as suggested by Lowe, and for this purpose asked
for financial aid from the imperial treasury. A commission of
inquiry then appointed by the French ministry of public works
reported favourably on the plans, though it declined to,
recommend a grant of money; but the further progress of the
scheme was interrupted by the outbreak of the Franco-German
war.</p>

<p>The tunnel was by no means the only plan in evidence at this
period for securing continuous railway communication between
England and France. An iron tube, resting on the bottom of the
sea, had been proposed by Tessier de Mottray in 1803, and had
again been considered by Thomé de Gamond in 1833; but after
1850 projects of this kind might almost be counted by the dozen.
Some of the structures were to be of iron, others of concrete or
masonry, and some were to be floated a moderate distance
below the surface. One of the most carefully worked out plans
was that of J. F. Bateman and J. Revy, who proposed to construct
a continuous tube, 13 ft. in internal diameter, of iron
rings each 10 ft. long, each ring being built out from the completed
portion of the tube by means of a horizontal chamber or
bell, which slid telescopically over the last few rings previously
put in place, and was moved forward by hydraulic power. About
the same time Zerah Colburn produced plans for a tube constructed
of 1000 ft. sections, which were to be built in dry dock
and then successively attached by a ball and socket joint to
the completed portion, the whole being raised from the bottom
and dragged out to sea, by the aid of a large number of ships,
as each section was attached and launched. Thomas Page,
again, the builder of Westminster Bridge, proposed to place
eight conical steel shafts at intervals across the Strait of Dover,
and to connect them by long sections of tube lowered from the
surface, the whole structure being covered with concrete when
finished. No attempt was made to put any of these plans into
execution, and the same was true of several bridge schemes
propounded about the same time; in one of these, spans one-half
or three-quarters of a mile in length were contemplated,
while another required 190 towers, 500 ft. apart and rising 500 ft.
above the water-level, which obviously would have constituted
an intolerable nuisance to navigation. The case, however, was
different with a train ferry which was vigorously advocated by
Sir John Fowler. His proposal was to employ steamers 450 ft.
long, with a beam of 57 ft. and a speed of 20 knots, having railway
lines laid down on their decks on and off which railway vehicles
could be run directly at each side of the strait. Dover was to
be the English port, while on the French coast a new harbour was
to be formed at Audresselles, between Calais and Boulogne.
This plan in 1872 received the sanction of the House of Commons,
but was rejected in the House of Lords by the casting vote of
the chairman of the committee. According to another similar
ferry scheme, which was worked out by Admiral Dupuy de
Lôme in 1870, a new maritime station was to be constructed
at Calais, so far off the shore that it would command deep water
at every state of the tide, and connected with the French railways
by a bridge.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian War, negotiations
concerning the tunnel were resumed between the French and
British governments, and in 1872 the latter intimated that it
had &ldquo;no objection in principle.&rdquo; After some further communications
between the two governments in 1874, settling the basis on
which the enterprise should be allowed to proceed, a joint commission
was appointed to arrange details relating to jurisdiction,
the right of blocking the tunnel, &amp;c., and this commission&rsquo;s
report was accepted as a basis of agreement between the governments.
In 1875 the Channel Tunnel Company obtained an act
authorizing it to undertake certain preliminary works at St
Margaret&rsquo;s Bay. In the same year the French Submarine Railway
Company obtained a concession, with the obligation to spend
a minimum of 2,000,000 francs in making investigations; in
fact it took over 3000 samples from the bottom of the sea in the
strait, and made over 7000 soundings, and also sunk a shaft
at Sangatte and started a heading. The English company did
not do so much, for it failed to raise the money it required and
its powers expired in 1880. Moreover, it was not the only company
in the field, and its programme was not universally accepted
as the best possible. Some authorities, such as Sir Joseph
Prestwich, doubted whether the tunnel should be attempted
in the chalk because of the likelihood of fissures being encountered
while others who thought the chalk suitable were dissatisfied
With the actual plans and formed a rival &ldquo;Anglo-French Submarine
Railway Company.&rdquo; In 1882 another tunnel company
made its appearance. In 1874 the South Eastern Railway
Company had obtained powers to sink experimental shafts on
its property between Dover and Folkestone, and in 1881 to
acquire lands, including the beach and foreshore, in that area
in connexion with a Channel tunnel. These powers resulted,
in 1882, in the formation of the Submarine Continental Railway
Company which in that year sought parliamentary sanction
for a tunnel, starting from a point west of Dover, at Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Cliff; and at the same time the resuscitated Channel Tunnel
Company applied for powers to make one from Fanhole, instead
of St Margaret&rsquo;s Bay as in its former scheme. The whole question
of the tunnel was then widely discussed and considered by various
committees, the last of which&mdash;a joint select committee of the
Lords and Commons&mdash;in 1883 expressed the opinion by a
majority that it was &ldquo;inexpedient that parliamentary sanction
should be given to a submarine communication between England
and France.&rdquo; This decision for the time being disposed of the
question of making a tunnel, and though Sir Edward Watkin,
one of its most prominent advocates, brought bill after bill before
parliament to authorize experimental works in connexion with
it, all were rejected. In 1882 the government interfered with
the operations then in progress, and they were ultimately
discontinued. They included a driftway 7 ft. in diameter which
was driven for a distance of about 2300 yds. eastwards under the
sea at an inclination of 1 in 72 from the bottom of a shaft sunk
to a depth of 164 ft. in the chalk marl at Shakespeare&rsquo;s Cliff.</p>

<p>About this time the Channel Bridge and Railway Company
took in hand the design of a bridge, the preliminary plans for
which were exhibited in the Paris Exhibition of 1889. The
terminal points were Folkestone and Cap Grisnez, and for the
sake of facilitating the laying of the pier foundations it was
proposed to take the bridge over the Varne and Colbart shoals.
The main girders were to be nearly 59 yds. above the sea-level,
the railway itself being more than 20 ft. higher still, and the spans
were to vary in length between 540 and 108 yds. As the result
of a survey of the sea bottom made in 1890, a modification in
the line of the bridge was adopted, and it was taken direct from
Cap Blancnez to the South Foreland. It was found that in this
way an excellent bottom would be obtained for the foundations,
and the length of the bridge would be 3 m. less, the number
of piers, by employing spans of 434 and 542 yds. alternately,
being reduced to 72. The cost of this structure was estimated
at £28,320,000, exclusive of interest on capital during the period
of construction, which was put at seven years. The same company
also worked out plans for a moving chariot or platform,
capable of holding a railway train and supported by long legs
on a submerged causeway or track constructed of steel or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page458" id="page458"></a>458</span>
armoured concrete 45 or 50 ft. below low-water level. No attempt
has been made actually to carry out either this project or that
of a bridge.</p>

<p>In 1905 the question of establishing a train ferry from Dover
across the Channel was brought forward by the Intercontinental
Railway Company, and in the following year the Channel Ferry
(Dover) Act was passed authorizing the work. About the same
period the Channel Tunnel Company, which had amalgamated
with the Submarine Railway Company, awoke to activity and
started a campaign in favour of its scheme; but the bill which
it promoted was opposed by the government and accordingly
was withdrawn in March 1907.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ENGLISH FINANCE.<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> The history of the English fiscal system
affords the best example known of continuous financial development,
in respect both of institutions and methods. Though
certain great periods of change can be readily noticed, yet from
the time of the Norman Conquest to the beginning of the 20th
century the line of connexion is substantially unbroken. Perhaps
the most revolutionary changes occurred in the 17th century,
as the outcome of the Civil War, and, later on, the revolution of
1688. But even in this case there was no real breach of continuity.
It is, therefore, possible to trace the normal growth
and expansion of British finance as one of the aspects of the
nation&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>The primitive financial institutions of England centre round
the king&rsquo;s household, or, in other words, the royal economy
precedes the national one. Revenue dues collected by the king&rsquo;s
agents, rents, or rather returns of produce, from land, and special
levies for emergencies form the elements of the royal income,
which gradually acquired greater regularity and consistency.
There is, however, little or no evidence of any effective financial
organization until we approach the 11th century. The influence
exercised from Normandy, which so powerfully affected the
English rulers at this time, tended towards the creation of records
of revenue claims and also of a central treasury.</p>

<p>With the union of England and Normandy under the same
head the idea of settled administrative methods was definitely
fixed and became of special importance in the field of finance.
The systematizing spirit, so characteristic of both the Norman
and Angevin kings, produced the great institution of the exchequer
(<i>q.v.</i>) with its judicial and administrative sides, and
its elaborate forms of account and control. Even before this
organization was developed the Domesday Survey (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Domesday
Book</a></span>)&mdash;now recognized as having a purely fiscal object (in Maitland&rsquo;s
words &ldquo;a tax book, a geld book&rdquo;)&mdash;shows the movement
towards careful observation of the sources of revenue. It is
clear that William I. initiated a policy which was followed by
his successors, in spite of the serious difficulties of the period of
anarchy during Stephen&rsquo;s nominal reign. The obscure question
as to the real origin of the special contrivances employed by the
exchequer is, strictly speaking, irrelevant to the financial inquirer,
who may be content to hold that, granting the existence of some
Old English analogies, the system, as it appears in the 12th
century, was a peculiar product of the conceptions as to fiscal
organization formed by Norman subtlety. It is the manner in
which this institution held together and focused the revenues and
expenditure of the kingdom that has to be considered. The
picture presented by the &ldquo;Dialogue of the Exchequer&rdquo; (c. 1176)
is that of a comprehensive system which secured the receipt
of the royal income, and provided a thorough audit of the
accounts by employing processes adapted to the circumstances
of the time. It is, in fact, through the description of financial
institutions that it is possible to ascertain the forms of revenue
possessed by the crown. The ingenuity expended on the
administrative machinery of the exchequer had as its aim the
increase of the king&rsquo;s resources, an object in which the official
class of churchmen and lawyers was deeply interested.</p>

<p>In order to understand the character Of English finance in
the middle ages it is absolutely essential to bear constantly
in mind the identification of the king with the state. Though
feudalism (<i>q.v.</i>) was, in one of its aspects, a powerful instrument
for division of political authority, it, nevertheless, in the particular
form in which the Conqueror introduced it into England, enabled
the fiscal rights of the crown to be established in a more definite
shape than was possible under the older condition. For, in the
first place, the actual property of the crown was more carefully
administered as each royal manor came under the system of
accounting. Again, the various claims or dues of the king took
more decidedly the feudal type and received stricter legal definition.
Further, the higher judicial organization assisted the
expansion of court fees; while, above all, the increased authority
of the state made the casual receipts (for such they were) from
trade more profitable.</p>

<p>In a broad view the sources of revenue fall under the following
heads:&mdash;(1) The royal estates which were distributed over
England, derived in part from the possessions of the old English
kings, but increased by the confiscations that followed the
events of the Conqueror&rsquo;s reign, as well as by the doctrine that
unowned land was the king&rsquo;s (<i>terra regis</i>). Over fourteen hundred
manors appear in Domesday as royal property. The forests,
placed under special laws, yielded little revenue, except in the
form of penalties on offenders. The rural tenants, who at first
paid their rents in produce, gradually commuted them into
money payments. As the royal demesne was favourable for
the growth of towns the rents derived from urban tenants
became a valuable part of the yield from the demesne; this,
later, took the shape of a payment from the town as a unit (the
<i>firma burgi</i>), a method which secured to the burghers freedom from
the exactions of the sheriff and which was purchased by special
payments. (2) The feudal rights. These included the claim to
military service; the three regular aids and the payments of
relief at succession to a fief, as also the profits on wardships and
marriages. Escheats and forfeitures completed the list. The
yield from this source varied with the power of the king and was
kept within bounds by the resistance of the tenants as shown
in the provisions of Magna Carta. (3) The administration of
justice was a lucrative prerogative of the crown. Suitors had to
pay for securing the hearing of their cases in addition to the fees
for writs, and both amercements and compositions increased
the receipts under this head. (4) Two special classes contributed
to the royal exchequer. As a great deal of the wealth of the
country was in the hands of the church the opportunities afforded
by the vacancies of sees, abbacies and priories were utilized for
the purpose of securing the profits of these offices during the time
in which there was no occupant; and this term was frequently
prolonged by the king&rsquo;s action or inaction. The Jews, until
their expulsion, were an even more profitable class to the revenue.
Being under the absolute control of the crown, they could be
taxed at pleasure, either by taking a percentage of their property
(<i>e.g.</i> in one case, one-fourth), or by levies for alleged offences.
The existence of a separate exchequer for the Jews is an indication
of their fiscal value. (5) Direct taxation formed an extraordinary
or occasional head of revenue. The Danegeld was succeeded by
the carucage, and the commutation of military service introduced
the scutage, but these forms were of little immediate importance,
though very significant for the future course of development.
(6) Lastly come the dues claimed at the ports, which contain
in germ the customs system of later times, though they rather
resemble the harbour charges of modern ports and were very
trivial in amount.</p>

<p>The history of the English financial system consists largely
in the exhibition of the different fortunes of these several component
parts of the exchequer receipts; for it must be remembered
that the sheriff was bound to account to that tribunal
for all that he should have received, and by this agency the local
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page459" id="page459"></a>459</span>
contributions passed into the king&rsquo;s possession for the service of
the state, During the century and a half that lay between the
Conquest and the granting of the Great Charter the account given
above holds good. The character of the ruler affected the vigour
of the fiscal, as well as the general, administration. Henry I.
and Henry II. secured much better results than Stephen or John;
but the collection of the rent and profits of the royal manors
and the feudal and other dues continued as the mainstay of
revenue. Indications of change are, however, to be found.
Thus the substitution of the &ldquo;carucage&rdquo; or plough tax for the
&ldquo;Danegeld&rdquo; marks an advance towards direct taxation of land
through its produce, and the introduction of &ldquo;scutage&rdquo; is not
only further evidence of the same tendency, but also a step in
the development of &ldquo;money economy&rdquo; in place of the earlier
&ldquo;natural economy&rdquo; or system of payments in kind. The special
levies or &ldquo;tallages&rdquo; imposed at times of need on the towns
in the king&rsquo;s demesne appear to have been a doubtful exercise
of the royal prerogative, but scientifically they belong to the
same class as the Danegeld and scutage. Perhaps the most
important advance made in this period is the beginning of
taxation of movables, first applied in the Saladin tithe of 1189
and, later, expanded into a general system.</p>

<p>In the reign of John (1199-1216) the loss of Normandy and
the concession of the barons&rsquo; demands by the issue of Magna
Carta rendered financial readjustments inevitable. During the
long reign of Henry III. the struggle to maintain the privileges
granted by the Charter acted on the fiscal system by checking
the arbitrary use of tallages, and as a consequence, encouraging
the regular assessment of the tax on movables, which was becoming
more prominent. The fruitful idea that it was necessary
to obtain the consent of the payers of taxes before the imposition
operated powerfully in favour of the establishment of bodies
representing the several estates. It is through the reaction of
constitutional on fiscal development that the transition from
feudal to parliamentary taxation in its earlier form is made.</p>

<p>Almost at the opening of the age of parliamentary taxation
one of the older sources of revenue ceased. The pressure of
popular <span class="correction" title="amended from opinon">opinion</span> forced Edward I. to decree the expulsion of
the Jews (1290), though he naturally desired to retain such
profitable subjects. It is, indeed, probable that, owing to the
exactions practised on them, the Jewish usurers had become
less serviceable to the exchequer; while it is certain that the
general resources of the kingdom had so increased as to make
their contribution relatively much smaller. The first effects of
the representative influence in the fiscal domain are the abandonment
of the tallages on towns and the decline of scutage as
a mode of levy. The tax on movables was framed in a more
systematic way. Instead of distinct charges on different classes,
or variations in proportion of levy from one-fourth to one-fortieth,
the policy of imposing a tax of one-tenth on the towns and
one-fifteenth on the counties was adopted. Greater strictness in
assessment was sought by the appointment of commissioners for
each county, supplied with special instructions as to taxable
goods and exemptions. This method continued in force for the
tax on movables from 1290 till 1334, though in some cases the
proportions imposed on the towns and counties were varied (<i>e.g.</i>
an eighth and a fifth were granted in 1297, and a tenth and
a sixth in 1322). A more general influence was the growing
national economy which led to greater activity on the part of the
king as administrator, and which also increased the need of the
state for revenue. Though the doctrine that &ldquo;The king should
live of his own&rdquo; was generally accepted as a constitutional
maxim, the force of events was making it obsolete. From being
an infrequent and uncertain kind of taxation the direct tax on
movables, which was practically absorbing the older forms,
became usual and regular. Under medieval conditions the
collection of a general property tax (for such, in fact, was the
nature of &ldquo;the tenth and fifteenth&rdquo;) presented serious difficulties.
Each locality gained by keeping its assessment down to the lowest
point, while the borough authorities were naturally not eager
to enforce the charge on their fellow-citizens. England in the
14th century was not ripe for a system that has been found hard
to make effective in more advanced societies. Hence, from 1334
onward, the method of &ldquo;apportionment&rdquo; was employed, <i>i.e.</i>
the tenth and fifteenth was taken as affording a definite sum
measured by the yield on the ancient valuation. As this gave,
in the aggregate, between £38,000 and £39,000, &ldquo;the tenth and
fifteenth&rdquo; became for the future &ldquo;practically a fiscal expression
for a sum of about £39,000&rdquo;; the total to be divided or &ldquo;apportioned&rdquo;
between the several counties, cities and boroughs according
to their former payments. This settlement, which remained
in force for centuries and affected all the later direct taxes, had
the great advantages of certainty and adaptability. The inhabitants
of any particular town knew their total liability and
could distribute it amongst themselves in the manner most convenient
to them. From the royal standpoint also the arrangement
was satisfactory, for the &ldquo;tenth and fifteenth&rdquo; could be multiplied
(<i>e.g.</i> in 1352 three &ldquo;tenths and fifteenths&rdquo; were voted for
three years), and supplied a stable revenue for the service of the
kingdom. To the parliament the power of regulating the policy
of the crown by the bestowal or refusal of grants was naturally
agreeable. Thus, all sections of the nation united in support of
the system established in 1334, just before the opening of the
Hundred Years&rsquo; War, in connexion with which it was particularly
serviceable.</p>

<p>Akin to the tax that has just been described, at least in its
nature as a direct impost, is the poll or capitation tax. Financial
pressure at the close of Edward III.&rsquo;s reign (1377) led to the
adoption of a tax of fourpence per head on all persons in the
kingdom (mendicants and persons under fourteen years being
excepted). This &ldquo;tallage of groats,&rdquo; which seems to be derived
by analogy from the hearth money for Peter&rsquo;s pence, was followed
by the graduated poll taxes of 1379 and 1380. In the former the
scale ranged from ten marks (£6:13:4) imposed on the royal
dukes and the viscounts, through six marks on earls, bishops and
abbots, and three on barons, down to the groat or fourpence
payable by all persons over sixteen years of age. Such a form
of taxation approximated&mdash;as Adam Smith saw&mdash;to an income
tax, but it proved to be unproductive, only half of the estimated
yield of £50,000 being obtained. The tax of 1380 varied within
narrower limits; from twenty shillings to fourpence (or sixty
groats to three), with the proviso that &ldquo;the strong should aid
the weak.&rdquo; But this particular tax is chiefly memorable as the
occasion&mdash;whatever may have been the real causes&mdash;of the great
&ldquo;Peasants&rsquo; Revolt&rdquo; of 1381. This unlucky association sealed
the fate of the poll tax as a fiscal expedient. It was abandoned,
with one exception, for nearly three hundred years; and its
occasional employment in the 17th century did not result in its
permanent revival. Apart from special circumstances it is plain
that the &ldquo;tenth and fifteenth&rdquo; was better suited than the
poll tax for the purpose of English finance. The machinery for
collection was ready to hand for the former, while special agents
had to gather the latter, even from the poorest classes. In fact,
the episode of the poll taxes may be regarded as an attempt&mdash;fortunately
unsuccessful&mdash;to relieve the propertied classes at the
expense of the peasants and poorer burghers. Failure in this
respect helped in the maintenance of the settlement of direct
taxation devised in 1334.</p>

<p>Parallel with the evolution of direct taxation, but decidedly
lagging behind, is the progress of indirect taxation. As already
mentioned, the right of levying dues on goods entering or leaving
English ports belonged from very early times to the king.
Whether this power was, in its origin, due to the protection
afforded to traders and thus a kind of insurance, or the result
of the royal prerogative of pre-emption is immaterial for finance.
What is established is that the &ldquo;prisage&rdquo; of wine or levy of one
cask in ten, and the taking of one-tenth or one-fifteenth of other
commodities was in force. Attempts to impose additional dues
were forbidden by an important article (41) of the Great Charter
which recognized &ldquo;the ancient and just customs.&rdquo; One of
the earliest effects of parliamentary influence is manifested
in the establishment of duties on wool, woolfells and leather by
Edward I.&rsquo;s first parliament. After some efforts by the king
to gather increased duties, the &ldquo;Confirmation of the Charters&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id="page460"></a>460</span>
(1297) forbade any increases on the amounts fixed in 1275, which
were henceforth known as the ancient customs. Another attempt
was made to obtain a higher scale of duties by arrangement with
the merchants. The foreign traders consented to the royal proposals,
which comprised duties on wine, wool, hides and wax,
as well as a general tax of 1¼% on all imports and exports.
Thus, in addition to the old customs of half a mark (6s. 8d.) per
sack of wool and on each three hundred woolfells, and one mark
(13s. 4d.) per last or load of leather, the foreign merchants paid
an extra duty (or surtax) of 50% and also 2s. on the tun of wine&mdash;the
so-called &ldquo;butlerage.&rdquo; The privileges granted in the
Carta Mercatoria (1303) were probably the consideration for
accepting these enhanced dues. The English merchants, however,
for the time, successfully resisted the application in their
case of the higher charges, and consequently remained under the
old prisage of wine. In spite of parliamentary opposition, on
the ground that they amounted to an infringement of the
Great Charter, the new customs were maintained in force.
After being suspended in 1311 they were revived in 1322, confirmed
by royal authority in 1328, and finally sanctioned by
parliament in the Statute of the Staple (1353). They became
a part of the permanent crown revenue from the ports, and, with
the old customs, were the basis for further development.</p>

<p>Just as the old direct taxes were first supplemented by, and
then absorbed in, the general taxation of movables, so the
customs, in the strict sense, were followed by the subsidies or
parliamentary grants. One great source of English wealth in
the 14th century was the export of the peculiarly fine wool of the
country, and the political circumstances of Edward III.&rsquo;s time
suggested the manipulation of the trade in this commodity for
purposes of policy as well as revenue. Sometimes, in order to
influence the towns of Flanders, the export of wool was absolutely
prohibited; at others, export duties of varying amounts
were imposed on wool, skins and leather. In the early years of
the reign these arrangements were settled by agreement with
the merchants. The subsidies of this class began in 1340 and
henceforward were frequently granted, though complaints were
very often made. Thus, in 1348 the Commons objected to the
subsidy of an export duty of £2 per sack on wool on the ground
that it was really a tax on the landowners, who received a lower
price for their wool in consequence of the duty. Bargains
between the king and the merchants were forbidden, and this
species of taxation was brought under parliamentary control by
statutes passed in 1362 and 1371. Along with the special duties
on wool there was an increase of the imposts on wine and general
goods. By agreement with the merchants a charge of 2s. per
tun on wine and 2½% on goods was levied in 1347. Between
1371 and 1376 these dues were established as parliamentary
grants under the names of &ldquo;Tunnage&rdquo; and &ldquo;Poundage,&rdquo;
leaving the older dues intact.</p>

<p>One class or &ldquo;estate&rdquo; occupied a peculiar position. The
clergy still claimed the privilege of self-taxation, and therefore it
was convocation, not parliament, that voted the tenths imposed
on clerical property. In some instances much heavier charges
(<i>e.g.</i> in 1296 one-third) were decreed by the king, but the taxation
of the clergy declined in productiveness during the 14th century.
By the close of the reign of Richard II. the results of the transition
from feudalism to a parliamentary constitution were
practically complete. In respect to finance the most important
of these were: (1) The disappearance or reduction to unimportance
of the feudal dues. The fact that this change occurred
at, relatively speaking, so early a date is of special significance
for English development. (2) The royal demesne, though it
had not suffered the losses that the grants of later times inflicted
on it, had also lost some of its value as a source of revenue.
(3) In compensation the direct taxation of property had become
a ready means of supplying the growing requirements of the
administration, and the mode of levy had been reduced to a
well-recognized form, unsatisfactory experiments&mdash;such as the
poll tax&mdash;being withdrawn. (4) The growth of import and export
duties through the &ldquo;old&rdquo; and &ldquo;new&rdquo; customs and the
subsidies furnished a large part of the requisite funds. In fact,
in the course of a little over three hundred years the constituent
parts of the public income had, without any violent change, been
completely altered in relative value and in organization.</p>

<p>The period of the Lancastrian kings, extending over two-thirds
of the 15th century (1399-1471), is noticeable for various
experiments in the system of direct taxation. The standard tax&mdash;&ldquo;the
tenth and fifteenth&rdquo;&mdash;failed to suit the changed conditions.
In consequence of the decay of some of the towns
allowances had to be made to them, amounting to over 15%
(£6000), which, with other deductions, lowered the yield from
a &ldquo;tenth and fifteenth&rdquo; to £31,000. As a supplement a land
tax, affecting only the large owners, was voted at the rate of 5%
in 1404, and repeated with wider scope, but at the lower rate of
1<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>%, in 1411. A house tax made its appearance in 1428.
Taxes on knight&rsquo;s fees and other freeholds were also tried, while
in 1435 and 1450 the graduated income tax was employed. The
minimum rate, 2½%, applied to incomes under £100 (or under
£20 in the tax of 1450), and rose to 10% on the higher incomes.
These devices are evidence of the demand for larger revenue,
and also of the increasing unfitness of the existing direct taxation.
It may be added that they indicate a disposition to adopt foreign
models, particularly the methods of taxation in use in France
and Italy. As to indirect taxation the receipts seem at first to
have declined, and the subsidies were only granted for fixed
terms (the victory of Agincourt gained a life grant to Henry V.).
After the establishment of Edward IV. on the throne, the idea
of a &ldquo;tenth,&rdquo; in the literal sense, was taken up and voted (1472)
by the two houses as a special military provision; but it failed
to bring in the required revenue, and the king had to fall back
on grants of the old-established form. Extra taxes on aliens were
levied under both Lancastrian and Yorkist rulers with little
profit. The most original contribution of Edward IV. to fiscal
policy was the &ldquo;benevolence&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>) or payment by wealthy
subjects of sums requested by the king. Voluntary in form, these
payments were, in fact, compulsory, and became in later times one
of the great grievances against which parliament had to struggle.</p>

<p>Broader issues in finance marked the course of the Tudor
period, and these were connected with the general history of the
time. The era of national monarchies had arrived, necessitating
the maintenance of greater military and naval forces, as well as
more costly machinery of administration. External policy was
affected by the set of ideas that developed into mercantilism
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mercantile System</a></span>); but so also was fiscal policy.
Finance reflected the actions of the personal rule that was the
characteristic of the 16th century. Within the period, however,
some decided contrasts are to be found. Prudence, carried to
parsimony with Henry VII., is followed by lavish prodigality in
the case of Henry VIII. Elizabeth, again, presents in her reign
a very different financial policy from that of either her father or
her grandfather. The desire for a vigorous foreign policy, the
hope of encouraging native industry, and the sentiment of retaliation
against the trade regulations of other countries are
found to interfere with the aim&mdash;strictly followed in earlier
times&mdash;of obtaining the largest possible yield. All the different
parts of the public economy were regarded as existing only in
order to be utilized for the furtherance of national power. It is
this more complex character in policy, coupled with the new
influences, that the discovery of America, the Renaissance and
the Reformation brought into operation, which gives special
interest to the financial problems of the 16th century.</p>

<p>Taking in order the great heads of public income placed at
the disposal of the sovereign, it appears that the first head of the
old receipts&mdash;the crown lands&mdash;had been from time to time
diminished by grants to the king&rsquo;s relatives and favourites, but
had also gained through resumptions and forfeitures. On the
whole, the loss and gain down to the close of the 14th century
was probably balanced. The revenue was, however, inelastic,
and declined in relative importance. It has been said that &ldquo;it
was in the 15th century that the great impoverishment of
the crown estate began.&rdquo; The Lancastrian kings (especially
Henry VI.) lost most of the lands attached to the crown through
pressure of expenditure and the wholesale plunder of officials.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page461" id="page461"></a>461</span>
Though the civil wars of the 15th century brought in many
forfeited estates the grants of Edward IV. kept down the increase.
But the chief opportunity for aggrandizement was afforded by
the dissolution of the monasteries and gilds under Henry VIII.
The great mass of property that passed into the royal possession
in this way was in part assigned to nobles and officials, while
most of the remainder was distributed in the reigns of his
children. The dwindling importance of the public revenue from
land and rent charges is as noticeable under the Tudors as in
earlier times. In like manner the feudal dues had fallen into a
very subordinate place notwithstanding the attempts made on
particular occasions to enforce them with greater rigour. The
force of personal monarchy exercised by the Tudors, depending
as it did on popular support, tended to encourage the collection
of dues which had a legal ground in preference to taxation of
the community. Of similar character was the employment of the
old right of purveyance (<i>q.v.</i>), in restraint of which a series of
statutes had been passed.</p>

<p>Whatever possibilities of obtaining some additional revenue
from the crown lands or prerogative rights may have existed in
the 16th century, and these were slight, all the political and
social conditions tended more and more to make the need of
taxation as the principal financial resource imperative. Amongst
the cases of increased calls for funds to maintain the machinery
of state, the rise of prices, due to increased supplies of the precious
metals, must be included as one of the chief, and its effect extends
into the 17th century. It was under this influence that the old
forms of revenue became less profitable and that fresh developments
were necessitated.</p>

<p>Direct taxation still retained in one of its branches the pattern
set in the reign of Edward III. &ldquo;Tenths and fifteenths&rdquo; continued
to be voted, and for some time all attempts to introduce
new methods failed. In 1488 a military grant framed on the
model of the abortive tax of 1472 yielded only a little over one-third
of the estimate (£27,000 out of £75,000), and the unsatisfactory
result prevented further experiments on the part of
Henry VII. The foreign policy of Henry VIII.&mdash;particularly
his French expedition&mdash;with its attendant outlay, accounts for
the graduated capitation tax of 1513, which was even less in
accordance with anticipation than the tax of 1488 (it yielded only
£50,000 instead of £160,000). But these failures cleared the way
for a more effective form of direct impost, which appeared in the
&ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; or general tax on land and goods. The first case of this
tax (1514) was a modest one-2½%; it, however, soon took on
a typical form, so that the subsidy came to mean a charge of 4s.
in the pound on land and 2s. 8d. in the pound on goods, a scale
evidently devised with reference to the older tenth and fifteenth,
which was henceforth put in a subordinate position. The subsidy
became the established mode of grant under both Tudors and
Stuarts, though by degrees it underwent a change similar to that
experienced by its predecessor. The taxing statutes made
elaborate provisions for the assessment and collection of the tax
in order to secure a full return. Old habits proved too strong
and the subsidy &ldquo;slipped into the same kind of groove as that
of the fifteenth and tenth, and became, in practice, a grant of
a sum of money of about the same amount as the yield of the last
preceding subsidy&rdquo; (Dowell). The consequence was that each
subsidy came, in the middle of the 16th century, to be a sum of
£100,000, and at its close only £80,000. The parallel vote of the
clergy in convocation (which after 1533 had to be confirmed
in parliament) amounted to £20,000. The usual parliamentary
proceeding was to vote so many &ldquo;tenths and fifteenths&rdquo; and
so many subsidies, <i>e.g.</i> Elizabeth&rsquo;s first parliament voted her
&ldquo;two fifteenths and tenths and a subsidy,&rdquo; or, taking the usual
values, £160,000. At times of crisis such as the arrival of the
Armada the votes were enlarged by granting more tenths and
fifteenths and subsidies. The history of the subsidy is instructive
as to the tendencies of direct taxation in all countries.
The assessment becomes inelastic and approximates to a fixed
sum. As the subsidy follows the course of the later medieval
taxation, so it is the undesigned model of the later land and
property tax.</p>

<p>In the history of the port duties under the Tudors the first point
for notice is the life grant to each of the sovereigns of the subsidies
on wool, hides and leather, together with tunnage at 3s. and
poundage at 5%; thus, with the hereditary customs, supplying a
considerable revenue for the crown&rsquo;s use. No better indication
of the increased power and popularity of the monarchy could be
found. The contrast with the suspicious and grudging attitude
of the Plantagenet and Lancastrian parliaments is significant of
the change in national sentiment. A duty on malmsey (1490) had
a retaliatory rather than a fiscal aim, being directed against the
Venetians who had imposed restrictions on English trade. In
several later cases wine became liable to extra duties, chiefly
applied to French trade in further pursuance of the policy of
retaliation. Restrictions on import and export as well as the
hostile measures against foreign merchants were matters of
economic policy rather than finance, but they had the indirect
effect of increasing the control exercised at the ports. The loss
of Calais (1558) dislocated the system of the staple and cut off
one centre of customs revenue; and it was also probably the
cause of an important change in the mode of valuing goods for
duty. For the declaration on oath of the merchant a fixed
valuation was substituted and set forth in a book of rates, the
first of its class (1558). Following this reform came more
stringent regulations against smuggling and fraud on the part of
officials. All through the Tudor period the cost of collection
was unduly high. For the first six years of Elizabeth it has
been estimated at one-sixth of the gross receipts.</p>

<p>Just as in the 14th century the subsidy had followed the
&ldquo;old&rdquo; and &ldquo;new&rdquo; customs, so in the 16th the &ldquo;impositions&rdquo;
levied by royal prerogative formed a supplement to the parliamentary
subsidy; but the principal employment of this expedient
occurs in the next century. Another significant indication
of the future course of indirect taxation was furnished by
the grants of monopolies to inventors, producers and traders.
These privileges, when they affected important commodities,
operated in the same way as taxes farmed out to collectors, and,
though the profit to the crown was small, they enhanced prices
and excited discontent. The wisdom of Elizabeth (or her
ministers) was shown in the promise of redress after the hostile
debate of 1601.</p>

<p>From one point of view it may fairly be said that the great
struggle of the Stuart kings with the parliament centred round
financial issues. It is, at all events, beyond dispute that questions
of taxation were the chosen ground of conflict. Taking
the period from the accession of James I. to the opening of the
Civil War (1603-42) it appears that the legal basis of indirect
taxation was tested for the port duties in the &ldquo;Great Case of
Impositions&rdquo; (known as Bates&rsquo; case, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bates, John</a></span>), while
that of direct taxation was considered in the even more famous
&ldquo;Ship Money&rdquo; case (for ever associated with the name of
Hampden). In parliament the debates deal with impositions,
monopolies, the grounds for voting subsidies, and the proper
application of the funds granted; in fact, with nearly all the
financial questions of the time. Notwithstanding these difficulties
and disputes the financial system shows evident signs of
expansion and adaptation to the needs of the state.</p>

<p>The direct grants of the parliaments of James I. far exceeded
those of earlier periods (in 1606 six &ldquo;fifteenths and tenths,&rdquo;
three lay and four clerical subsidies), but the efforts to extend
the other sources of revenue by the exercise of the prerogative
naturally reacted on this spirit of liberality. The last &ldquo;fifteenth
and tenth&rdquo; was voted in 1624, from which date this old-established
form disappears, and the subsidy alone is used. In spite
of Charles I.&rsquo;s high-handed policy five subsidies were voted after
the Petition of Right had been accepted, and even the Long
Parliament made similar grants. Almost at the outbreak of the
Civil War it also gave the king a graduated capitation tax.
Other modes of direct taxation were used without parliamentary
sanction. The collection of the antiquated feudal dues was
enforced through the special courts (particularly the Star
Chamber) with a rigour long unknown; James had tried the
French device of a &ldquo;tariff of honors.&rdquo; Both kings employed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page462" id="page462"></a>462</span>
the &ldquo;benevolence&rdquo; until the Petition of Right made such a levy
illegal. But by far the most serious innovation was the collection
of the &ldquo;ship money,&rdquo; a course forced on Charles by his determination
not to meet the representatives of the nation. The
writs &ldquo;embodied the ultimate expression of the ingenuity of the
king&rsquo;s advisers in the invention of means to enable him to rule
without a parliament.&rdquo; The first writs secured over £100,000,
and were followed by five further issues (1634-1639) bringing
in an average return of £200,000 or about three lay subsidies.
Like the &ldquo;benevolence,&rdquo; the ship money was declared to be
illegal (1641).</p>

<p>The contest respecting monopolies, settled by Elizabeth&rsquo;s
withdrawal, was revived under James I., and had to be finally
closed by the Statute of Monopolies (1624), declaring such grants
to be utterly void. Certain exceptions (as in the case of the soap-boilers)
permitted the raising of revenue by what was in fact a
rudimentary excise, and plans for a general excise were discussed,
especially as a substitute for the feudal dues, though they were
not reduced to practice. In the earlier 17th century the customs
show a steady increase. From £127,000 in 1604 they rose to nearly
£500,000 in 1641. This fourfold increase was due in part to the
growth of English trade, but it was also influenced by the adoption
of new &ldquo;Books of rates&rdquo; in 1608 and 1635, fixing higher
valuations, and by the inclusion of new commodities with
definite duties. Wine, currants (the subject of controversy in
Bates&rsquo; case) and tobacco are particularly noticeable. Sugar also
appears as a contributory. An interesting development was the
adoption on a larger scale of the &ldquo;farming&rdquo; system, an evident
imitation from France. A distinction was made between the
&ldquo;great,&rdquo; the &ldquo;petty&rdquo; and the &ldquo;sugar&rdquo; farms, and opportunities
for gain were afforded to the officials. On the constitutional
side the life grant of subsidies, made in accordance with
Tudor usage to James, was temporarily withheld from Charles,
a restriction which his own overbearing policy led the parliament
to maintain. Practically, the whole customs revenue between
1628 and 1640 was raised by the use of the prerogative without
any parliamentary sanction. The Tunnage and Poundage Act
of 1641 pronounced definitely against the legality of any extra
parliamentary customs and thus closed another of the constitutional
problems of finance.</p>

<p>In the progress from the Conquest to the crisis of the Great
Rebellion there is noticeable a practically complete shifting
of the classes of revenue. The king had ceased &ldquo;to live of his
own&rdquo;; the royal demesne and the prerogative rights included
in feudalism had become very subordinate. The direct taxation
of property and income, and the indirect taxation on imported
or exported commodities became the principal forms of receipt.</p>

<p>In the long course of English financial history the nearest
approach to the new departure and an abandonment of old
devices is found at the time of the Civil War and Commonwealth.
The actual outlines of the now existing system made their
appearances, while the older portions of the revenue&mdash;particularly
the survivals of feudalism&mdash;are eliminated. Thus the
Civil War and the Interregnum (1642-60) may be regarded as
marking a watershed in the financial history of the country.
At the beginning of the struggle both sides had to rely on voluntary
contributions. Plate and ornaments were melted down
and useful commodities were furnished by the adherents of the
king and by those of the parliament. As holding possession of
London and the central organization the parliament voted subsidies
and a poll tax. Such imports could hardly be levied with
success and new forms became necessary. The direct taxation
took the shape of a &ldquo;monthly assessment&rdquo; which was fixed from
time to time, and which was collected under strict regulations, in
marked contrast to the lax management of the former subsidies.
As the amount for each district was fixed, the systematic collection
secured &ldquo;the more equitable adjustment of the burden of
the tax as regards the various taxpayers&rdquo; without hardship to
the community. In spite of its origin, the &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; was the
model for later taxation of property. The yield of this tax&mdash;exceeding
for the whole period £32,000,000&mdash;is a proof of its
importance. Minor contrivances, <i>e.g.</i> the &ldquo;weekly meal&rdquo; tax, indicate
the financial difficulties of the parliament, but are otherwise
unimportant. Owing to its control of the sea and the principal
ports the parliament was able to command the customs revenue;
and in this case also it remodelled the duties, abolishing the wool
subsidy and readjusting the general customs by a new book of
rates. A more extensive tariff was adopted in 1656, and various
restrictions in harmony with the mercantilist ideas of the time
were enforced. Thus French wines, silk and wool were excluded
from 1649 to 1656. Far more revolutionary in its effects was
the introduction of the excise or inland duties on goods&mdash;a step
which Elizabeth, James I. and Charles I. had hesitated to take.
Beginning (1643) with duties on ale, beer and spirits, it was soon
extended to meat, salt and various textiles. Meat and domestic
salt were relieved in 1647, and the taxation became definitely
established under the administration of commissioners appointed
for the purpose. Powers to let out the collection to farmers were
granted, and a bid for both excise and customs amounted in
1657 to £1,100,000. Confiscations of church lands and those
belonging to royalists, feudal charges and special collections
helped to make up the total of £83,000,000 raised during the
nineteen years of this revolutionary period. Another mark of
change was the removal of the exchequer to Oxford, leaving,
however, the real fiscal machinery at the disposal of the committees
that directed the affairs of the parliament. Under
Cromwell the exchequer was re-established (1654) in a form
suited for the changes in the finances, the office of treasurer
being placed in the hands of commissioners.</p>

<p>A complete reconstruction of the revenue system became
necessary at the Restoration. The feudal tenures and dues, with
the prerogative rights of purveyance and pre-emption, which
had been abolished by order of the parliament, could not be
restored. Their removal was confirmed, and the new revenues
that had been developed were resorted to as a substitute. Careful
inquiry showed that just before the Civil War the king&rsquo;s
annual revenue had reached nearly £900,000. The needs of the
restored monarchy were estimated at £1,200,000 per annum,
and the loyal spirit of the commons provided sources of revenue
deemed sufficient for this amount. An hereditary excise on
beer and ale was voted as a compensation for the loss of the
feudal dues, and temporary excises on spirits, vinegar, coffee,
chocolate and tea were added. All differences of &ldquo;old&rdquo; and
&ldquo;new&rdquo; customs and subsidies had disappeared under the
Commonwealth. The general or &ldquo;great statute&rdquo; (1660) provided
a scale of duties&mdash;5% on imports and exports, with special
duties on wines and woollen cloths&mdash;accompanied by a new
book of rates. A house tax, levied after the French pattern, on
each hearth, was introduced in 1662 and became established.
Poll taxes were used as an extraordinary resource, as were the
last subsidies, voted in 1663, and then for ever abandoned.
Licences on retailers and fees on law proceedings were further
aids to the revenue, which, in the later years of Charles II.
and in the short reign of his successor, was with difficulty kept
up to the level of the increasing expenditure. The Commonwealth
assessments were revived on several occasions, and
indirect taxation was made more rigorous by the imposition of
extra duties on brandy, tobacco and sugar, as also on French
linens and silks. A very important development was the placing
of the customs (1670) and the excise (1683) in the hands of special
commissioners, instead of the system of farming them out to
private collectors. The approach to modern conditions is further
evidenced by the greater care in the administration. Amongst
expert officials Dudley North (<i>q.v.</i>), as commissioner of customs,
was the most distinguished. In this period, too, the beginning
of the public debt as in the appropriation of the bankers&rsquo; deposits
may be found.</p>

<p>The Revolution of 1688 may be regarded both on its constitutional
and financial sides as the completion of the work of
the Long Parliament. In the latter respect its chief effects were:
(1) the transfer of the administration of the finances from the
king&rsquo;s nominees to officials under parliamentary control, (2) the
consequent application of the revenue to the purposes designated
by parliamentary appropriation, (3) the rapid expansion of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page463" id="page463"></a>463</span>
various kinds of revenue, particularly the indirect taxes, (4) the
rise and growth of the national debt, combined with the creation
of an effective banking system. The greater part of the 18th
century was occupied with the working out of these results.</p>

<p>The government of William III. had to face the expenses of
a great war and to allay discontent at home. As a preliminary
step to the necessary settlement of the revenue a return was
prepared, showing the tax receipts at over £1,800,000 and the
peace expenditure at about £1,100,000. Parliament accepted
the view that £1,200,000 per annum would suffice for the ordinary
requirements of the kingdom. It, further, introduced the system
of the Civil List (<i>q.v.</i>) and assigned £600,000 for the fixed payments
placed under that head, leaving the remainder to be
appropriated for the other needs of the state. As the &ldquo;hearth
money&rdquo; had proved to be a very unpopular charge, it was, in
spite of its yield (£170,000), given up. The temporary excise
duties were voted for &ldquo;their majesties&rsquo; lives&rdquo; and the customs
for a limited term. These branches of revenue were altogether
insufficient to meet the pressure of the war outlay, and in consequence
new heads of taxation&mdash;or old ones revived&mdash;came into
use. A series of poll and capitation taxes were imposed between
1689 and 1698, but were after that date abandoned for the same
reason as that for the repeal of the hearth money. The monthly
assessment was tried in 1688; then came an income tax followed
by &ldquo;twelve months&rsquo;&rdquo; assessments in 1690 and 1691. The way
was thus prepared for the property tax of 1692, imposing a rate
of 4s. in the pound on real estate, offices and personal property.
The old difficulties of securing returns made the tax chiefly
one on land. It was under the name of &ldquo;the land tax&rdquo; that it
was generally known. The 4s. rate brought in £1,922,712, a
return which declined in the following years. To meet this a fixed
quota of nearly half a million (a 1s. rate) was adopted in 1697,
the amount to be apportioned in specified sums to the several
counties and towns. The framework of the tax remained without
substantial change till 1798, the time of Pitt&rsquo;s redemption scheme.
In 1696 houses were taxed 2s. each, with higher rates for extra
windows. The beginning of the &ldquo;window tax,&rdquo; licences on
pedlars, and a temporary tax on the stocks of companies complete
the imposts of this kind. Stamp duties&mdash;imitated from
Holland&mdash;were adopted in 1694 and extended in 1698: they
mark the beginnings of the modern duties on transactions and
the &ldquo;death duties.&rdquo; Large additions were made to the excise.
Breweries and distilleries were placed under charge, and such
important commodities as salt, coal, malt, leather and glass were
included in the list of taxable articles, but the two last mentioned
were soon relieved for the time. The customs rates were also
increased. In 1698 the general 5% duty was raised by the new
subsidy to 10%. French goods became liable to surtaxes, first
of 25%, afterwards of 50%; those of other countries had to pay
similar charges of smaller amount. Spirits, wines, tea and coffee
were taxed at special rates. How great was the expansion of the
fiscal system may be best realized from the fact that during the
comparatively short reign of William III. (1689-1702) the land
tax produced £19,200,000, the customs £13,296,000, and the
excise £13,650,000, or altogether £46,000,000. In the last year
of the reign, the opening one of the 18th century, the returns from
these taxes respectively were: land tax (at 2s.), £990,000,
customs £1,540,000, excise £986,000, or a total exceeding three
and a half millions. The removal of the regular export duties
in respect of (a) domestic woollen manufactures, (b) corn, was
the only alleviation of taxation, and in both cases it was due to
special reasons of policy.</p>

<p>Quite as remarkable as the growth of revenue is the sudden
appearance of the use of public loans. In earlier periods a ruler
had accumulated treasure (Henry VII. left £1,800,000) or had
pledged &ldquo;his jewels or the customs or occasionally the persons
of his friends for the payment&rdquo; of his borrowings. Edward III.&rsquo;s
dealings with the Florentine bankers are well known; but it was
only after the Revolution that the two conditions essential for
a permanent public debt were realized, viz.: (1) the responsibility
of the government to the people, and (2) an effective
market for floating capital. At the close of the war in 1697 a
debt of £21,500,000 had been incurred, over £16,000,000 of which
remained due at William III.&rsquo;s death. Connected with the
public debt is the foundation of the Bank of England (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Banks
and Banking</a></span>), which more and more became the agent for
dealing with the state revenue and expenditure; though the
exchequer continued to exist until 1834 as a real, even if antiquated
institution.</p>

<p>Thus it is clear that by the end of the 17th century the new
influences which date from the Civil War had brought into being
all the elements of the modern financial system. Expenditure,
revenue, borrowing to meet deficiencies are all, in a sense, developed
into their present-day form. Increase in amount and
some refinements in procedure, combined with improved views
of public policy, are the only changes that occur later on.</p>

<p>Regarded broadly, the 18th and 19th centuries exhibit several
distinct periods with definite financial aspects. In the ninety
years from the death of William III. (1702) to the outbreak of
the Revolutionary War with France (1793) there are four serious
wars, covering nearly thirty-five years. There is the long peace
administration of Walpole, and there are the shorter intervals
of rest following each of the contests. From the beginning of
the war with the French Republic to the year of Waterloo there
is a nearly unbroken war time of over twenty years. The forty
years&rsquo; peace is closed by the Crimean War (1854-56); and
another forty years of peace ends with the South African War
(1899-1902). During this time the older mercantilism passes
into protectionism; and this, again, gives way before the gradual
adoption of the free trade policy. At each time of war, taxation
(particularly in the indirect form) and debt increase. Financial
reform is connected with the maintenance of peace. Among
the great financial ministers Walpole, the younger Pitt, Peel
and Gladstone are conspicuous; while Huskisson&rsquo;s services in
the kindred field of economic policy deserve special notice in their
financial bearing.</p>

<p>By taking the several great heads of revenue in order it is
comparatively easy to understand the nature of the progress
made in subsequent years. (1) The land tax, established on a
definite basis in 1692, was the great 18th century form of direct
taxation. Varying in rate from 1s. (as in 1731) to 4s. (as in most
war years), it was converted by Pitt in 1798 into a redeemable
charge on the lands of each parish, and by this process has sunk
from the amount of £1,911,000 in 1798 to £730,000 in 1907-1908.
The great increase in other heads had impaired the value of the
land tax as a fiscal support. (2) Parallel with the movement
of the land tax but showing much more rapid growth was the
excise of the 18th century. Most of the articles of common
consumption were permanently taxed. Soap, salt, candles and
leather are described by Adam Smith as taxed, and that taxation
is unreservedly condemned by him. In 1739 the excise duties
brought in £3,000,000. By 1792 they had risen to £10,000,000.
Their continued expansion was due both to the wider area
covered and to the increased consuming power of the country.
(3) The customs were equally serviceable, and in their case the
increased duties were even more considerable. The general
10% of 1698 became 15% in 1704, a fourth 5% was imposed
in 1748, and in 1759 the general duties were raised to 25%.
Coincidently with this general extension of the customs duties
special articles such as tea were subjected to increased duties.
The American War of Independence brought about a further
general increase of 10%, together with special extra duties on
tobacco and sugar. In 1784 the customs revenue came to over
£3,000,000. Two circumstances account for this slower growth.
(1) The extreme rigour of the duties and prohibitions, aimed
chiefly against French trade; and (2) the absence of care in
estimating the point of maximum productiveness for each duty.
Swift&rsquo;s famous saying that &ldquo;in the arithmetic of the customs
two and two sometimes, made only one&rdquo; is well exemplified
in England at this time. The smuggler did a great deal of the
foreign trade of the country. Efforts at reform were not, however,
altogether wanting. Walpole succeeded in carrying several
useful adjustments. He abolished the general duties on exports
and also several of those on imported raw materials such as silk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page464" id="page464"></a>464</span>
beaver, indigo and colonial timber. His most ambitious scheme&mdash;that
for the warehousing of wine and tobacco in order to relieve
exporters&mdash;failed, in consequence of the popular belief that it
was the forerunner of a general excise. Walpole&rsquo;s treatment of
the land tax, which he kept down to the lowest figure (1s.), and
his earlier funding plan deserve notice. His determination to
preserve peace assisted his fiscal reforms. Pitt&rsquo;s administration
from 1783 to 1792 marks another great period of improvement.
The consolidation of the customs laws (1787), the reduction of
the tea duty to nearly one-tenth of its former amount, the conclusion
of a liberal commercial treaty with France, and the
attempted trade arrangement with Ireland, tend to show that
&ldquo;Pitt would have anticipated many of the free trade measures
of later years if it had been his lot to enjoy ten more years of
peaceful administration.&rdquo; One of the financial problems which
excited the interest and even the alarm of the students of public
affairs was the rapid increase of the public debt. Each war
caused a great addition to the burden; the intervals of peace
showed very little diminution in it. From sixteen millions in
1702, the debt rose to £53,000,000 at the treaty of Utrecht (1713).
In 1748 it reached £78,000,000, at the close of the Seven Years&rsquo;
War it was £137,000,000, and when the American colonies had
established their independence it exceeded £238,000,000. Apprehensions
of national bankruptcy led to the adoption of the device
of a sinking fund, and in this case Pitt&rsquo;s usual sagacity seems
to have failed him. The influence of R. Price&rsquo;s theory induced
the policy of assigning special sums for debt reduction, without
regard to the fundamental condition of maintaining a real
surplus.</p>

<p>The revolutionary and Napoleonic wars mark an important
stage in English finance. The national resources were strained
to the utmost, and the &ldquo;whip and spur&rdquo; of taxation was used
on all classes of the community. In the earlier years of the
struggle the expedient of borrowing enabled the government to
avoid the more oppressive forms of charge; but as time went
on every possible expedient was brought into play. One class
of taxes had been organized during peace&mdash;the &ldquo;assessed taxes&rdquo;
on houses, carriages, servants; horses, plate, &amp;c. These duties
were raised by several steps of 10% each until, in 1798, their
total charge was increased threefold (for richer persons four- or
fivefold) under the plan of a &ldquo;triple assessment.&rdquo; The comparative
failure of this scheme (which did not bring in the estimated
yield of £4,500,000) prepared the way for the most important
development of the tax system&mdash;the introduction of the income-tax
in 1798. Though a development of the triple assessment,
the income-tax was also connected with the permanent settlement
of the land tax as a redeemable charge. It is possible to
trace the progress of direct taxation from the scutage of Norman
days through &ldquo;the tenth and fifteenth,&rdquo; the Tudor &ldquo;subsidies,&rdquo;
the Commonwealth &ldquo;monthly assessments,&rdquo; and the 18th century
land tax, to the income-tax as applied by Pitt, and, after
an interval of disuse, revived by Peel (1842). The immediate
yield of the income-tax was rather less than was expected
(£6,000,000 out of £7,500,000); but by alteration of the mode of
assessment from that of a general declaration to returns under
the several schedules, the tax became, first at 5%, afterwards at
10%, the most valuable part of the revenue. In 1815 it contributed
22% of the total receipts (<i>i.e.</i> £14,600,000 out of
£67,000,000). If employed at the beginning of the war, it would
probably have obviated most of the financial difficulties of the
government. The window tax, which continued all through
the 18th century, had been supplemented in the American War
by a tax on inhabited houses (one of Adam Smith&rsquo;s many suggestions),
a group to which the assessment taxes were naturally joined.
During the 18th century the probate duty had been gradually
raised, and in 1780 the legacy duty was introduced; but these
charges were moderate in character and did not affect land.
Though the direct and quasi-direct taxes had been so largely
increased, their growth was eclipsed by that of the excise and
customs. With each succeeding year of war new articles for
duties were detected and the rates of old taxes raised. The maxim,
said to have guided the financiers of another country&mdash;&ldquo;Wherever
you see an object, tax it&rdquo;&mdash;would fairly express the guiding
policy of the English system of the early 19th century. Eatables,
liquors, the materials of industry, manufactures, and the transactions
of commerce had in nearly all their forms to pay toll.
To take examples:&mdash;salt paid 15s. per bushel; sugar 30s. per
cwt.; beer 10s. per barrel (with 4s. 5d. per bushel on malt and
a duty on hops); tea 96% <i>ad valorem</i>. Timber, cotton, raw
silk, hemp and bar iron were taxed, so were leather, soap, glass,
candles, paper and starch. In spite of the need of revenue, many
of the customs duties were framed on the protective system and
thereby gave little returns; <i>e.g.</i> the import duty on salt in 1815
produced £547, as against £1,616,124 from excise; pill-boxes
brought in 18s. 10d., saltpetre 2d., with 1d. for the war duties.
The course of the war taxation was marked by varied experiments.
Duties were raised, lowered, raised again, or given some
new form in the effort to find additional revenue. Some duties,
<i>e.g.</i> that on gloves, were abandoned as unproductive; but the
conclusion is irresistible that the financial system suffered from
over-complication and absence of principle. In the period of
his peace administration Pitt was prepared to follow the teaching
of <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>. The strain of a gigantic war forced
him and his successors to employ whatever heads of taxation
were likely to bring in funds without violating popular prejudices.
Along with taxation, debt increased. For the first ten years
the addition to it averaged £27,000,000 per annum, bringing
the total to over £500,000,000. By the close of the war period
in 1815 the total reached over £875,000,000, or a somewhat
smaller annual increase&mdash;a result due to the adoption of more
effective tax forms, and particularly the income tax. The
progress of English trade was another contributing agency
towards securing higher revenue. The import of articles such
as tea advanced with the growing population; so that the tea
duty of 96% yielded in 1815 no less than £3,591,000. It is,
however, true that by the year just mentioned the tax system
had reached its limit. Further extension (except by direct
confiscation of property) was hardly possible. The war closed
victoriously at the moment when its prolongation seemed
unendurable.</p>

<p>A particular aspect of the English financial system is its
relation to the organization of the finance of territories connected
with the English crown. The exchequer may be plausibly held
to have been derived from Normandy, and wherever territory
came under English rule the methods familiar at home seem to
have been adopted. With the loss of the French possessions the
older cases of the kind disappeared. Ireland, however, had its
own exchequer, and Scotland remained a distinct kingdom.
The 18th century introduced a remarkable change. One of the
aims of the union with Scotland was to secure freedom of commerce
throughout Great Britain, and the two revenue systems
were amalgamated. Scotland was assigned a very moderate
share of the land tax (under one-fortieth), and was exempted
from certain stamp duties. The attempt to apply selected
forms of taxation&mdash;custom duties (1764), stamp duties (1765),
and finally the effort to collect the tea duty (1773)&mdash;to the
American colonies are indications of a movement towards what
would now be called &ldquo;imperialist&rdquo; finance. The complete plan
of federation for the British empire, outlined by Adam Smith,
is avowedly actuated by financial considerations. Notwithstanding
the failure of this movement in the case of the colonies,
the close of the century saw it successful in respect to Ireland,
though separate financial departments were retained till after
the close of the Napoleonic War and some fiscal differences still
remain. By the consolidation of the English and Irish exchequers
and the passage from war to peace, the years between
1815 and 1820 may be said to mark a distinct step in the financial
development of the country. The connected change in the Bank
of England by the resumption of specie payments supports this
view. Moreover, the political conditions in their influence on
finance were undergoing a revolution. The landed interest,
though powerful at the moment, had henceforth to face the
rivalry of the wealthy manufacturing communities of the north
of England, and it may be added that the influence of theoretic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page465" id="page465"></a>465</span>
discussion was likely to be felt in the treatment of the financial
policy of the nation. Canons as to the proper system of administration,
taxation and borrowing come to be noticed by statesmen
and officials.</p>

<p>These influences may be followed out in their working by
observing the chief lines of adjustment and modification that
followed the conclusion of peace. Relieved from the extraordinary
outlay of the preceding years, the government felt
bound to propose reductions. With commendable prudence it
was resolved to retain the income-tax at 5% (one-half of the
former rate), and to join with this reduction the removal of some
war duties on malt and spirits. Popular feeling against direct
taxation was so strong that the income-tax had to be surrendered
<i>in toto</i>, a course which seriously embarrassed the finances of the
following years. For over twenty-five years the income-tax
remained in abeyance, to the great detriment of the revenue
system. Its revival by Peel (1842), intended as a temporary
expedient, proved its services as a permanent tax: it has continued
and expanded considerably since. Both the excise and
customs at the close of the war were marked by some of the
worst defects of a vicious kind of taxation. The former had the
evil effect of restricting the progress of industry and hampering
invention. The raw materials and the auxiliary substances of
industry were in many cases raised in price. The duties on salt
and glass specially illustrated the bad results of the excise.
New processes were hindered and routine made compulsory.
The customs duties were still more restrictive of trade; as they
practically excluded foreign manufactures, and were both costly
and in many instances unproductive of revenue. As G. R.
Porter has shown, the really profitable customs taxes were few in
number. Less than a score of articles contributed more than
nineteen-twentieths of the revenue from import duties. The
duties on transactions, levied chiefly by stamps, were ill-graded
and lacking in comprehensiveness. From the standpoint of
equity the ground for criticism was equally plain. The great
weight of taxation fell on the poorer classes. The owners of land
escaped giving any return for the property that they held under
the state, and other persons were not taxed in proportion to their
abilities, which had been long recognized as the proper criterion.</p>

<p>The grievance as to distribution has been modified, if not
removed, by the great development of (1) the income-tax, (2)
the &ldquo;death&rdquo; or inheritance duties. Beginning at the rate of
7d. per pound (1842-1854), the income-tax was raised to 1s. 4d.
for the Crimean War, and then continued at varying rates;
reduced to 2d. in 1874, it rose to 5d., then in 1894 to 8d., and by
1909 appeared to be fixed as a minimum at 1s., or 5% on income
from property. The yield per penny on the £ has risen almost
uninterruptedly. From £710,000 in 1842, it now exceeds
£2,800,000, though the exemptions and abatements are much
more extensive. In fact, all incomes of £3 per week are absolutely
free (£160 per annum is the precise exemption limit), and
an income of £400 derived from personal exertion pays less than
5½d. per pound, or 2¼%. The great productiveness of the tax is
equally remarkable. From £5,600,000 in 1843 (with a rate of 7d.)
the return rose to £32,380,000 in 1907-1908, having been at the
maximum of £38,800,000 in 1902-1903, with a tax rate of 6¼%.
The income-tax thus supplies about one-fifth of the total revenue,
or one-fourth of that obtained by taxation. Several fundamental
questions of finance are connected with the taxation of income
and have been dealt with by English practice. Small incomes
claim lenient treatment; and, as mentioned above, this leniency
means in England complete freedom. Again, earned incomes
appear to represent lower ability to pay than unearned ones.
Long refused on practical grounds (as by Gladstone and Lowe),
the concession of an abatement of 25% on earned incomes of
£2000 and under was granted in 1907. The question whether
savings should be exempt from taxation as income has (with the
exception of life insurance premiums) been decided in the negative.
Allowances for depreciation and cost of repairs are partially
recognized. Far more important than these special problems
is the general one of increased tax rates on large incomes. Up
to 1908-1909 the tax above the abatement limit of £700 remained
strictly proportional; but opinion showed a decided tendency
in favour of extra rates or a &ldquo;super tax&rdquo; on incomes above an
assigned amount (<i>e.g.</i> £5000), and this was included in the
budget of 1909-1910 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Income-Tax</a></span>).</p>

<p>In close relation with the income-tax is the estate duty, with
its adjuncts of Legacy and Succession Duties. After Pitt&rsquo;s
failure to carry the succession duty in 1796, no change was made
till Gladstone&rsquo;s introduction in 1853 of a duty on land and settled
property parallel to the legacy duty on free personality. Apart
from certain minor alterations, the really vital change was the
extension in 1894 of the old Probate Duty into a comprehensive
impost (entitled the Estate Duty) applicable to all the possessions
of a deceased person. This &ldquo;Inheritance Tax&rdquo;&mdash;to give it its
scientific title&mdash;operates as a complementary property tax, and
is thus an addition to the contribution from incomes derived from
large properties. By graduation the charges on large estates
in 1908-1909 (before the proposal for further increase in 1909-1910)
came to 10% on £1,000,000, and reached the maximum
of 15% at £3,500,000. From the several forms of the &ldquo;Inheritance
Taxes&rdquo; the national revenue gained £14,500,000, with
4½ millions as a supplementary yield for local finance. The
immense expansion of direct taxation is evident on comparing
1840 with 1908. In the former year the Probate and legacy
duties brought in about one million; the other direct taxes,
even including the &ldquo;House duty,&rdquo; did not raise the total to
£3,000,000. In 1908 the direct taxation of property and income
supplied £51,500,000, or one-third of the total receipts as against
less than one-twentieth in 1840.</p>

<p>But though this wider employment of direct taxation&mdash;a
characteristic of European finance generally&mdash;reduced the
<i>relative</i> position of the taxation of commodities, there was a
growth in the absolute amount obtained from this category of
duties. There were also considerable alterations, the result of
changes in the views respecting fiscal policy. At the close of the
Great War the excise duties were at first retained, and even in
some cases increased. After some years reforms began. The
following articles amongst others were freed from charge:
salt (1825); leather and candles (1830); glass (1845); soap
(1853); and paper (1860). The guiding principles were: (1) the
removal of raw materials from the list of goods liable to excise,
(2) the limitation of the excise to a small number of productive
articles, with (3) the placing of the greater part (practically
nearly the whole) of this form of taxation on alcoholic drinks.
Apart from breweries and distilleries, the excise had little field
for its work. The large revenue of £35,700,000 in 1907-1908 was
derived one-half from spirits (£17,700,000), over one-third from
beer, while most of the remainder was obtained from business
taxation in the form of licences, the raising of which was one of
the features of the budget in 1909. As a feeder of the revenue
the excise might be regarded as equal to the income-tax, but less
to be relied on in times of depression. Valuable as were the
reforms of the excise after 1820, they were insignificant as
compared with the changes in the customs. The particular
circumstances of English political life have led to perhaps undue
emphasis being placed on this particular branch of financial
development. Between 1820 and 1860 the customs system was
transformed from a highly complicated arrangement of duties,
pressing with severity on nearly all foreign imports, into a simple
and easily understood set of charges on certain specially selected
commodities. All favours or preferences to home or colonial
producers disappeared. Expressed in financial terms, all duties
were imposed &ldquo;for revenue only,&rdquo; and estimated in reference
to their productiveness. An assimilation between the excise
and customs rates necessarily followed. The stages of the
development under the guidance of (1) Huskisson, (2) Peel, and
(3) Gladstone are commonly regarded as part of the movement
for Free Trade; but the financial working of the alteration is
understood only by remembering that the duties removed by
&ldquo;tens&rdquo; or by &ldquo;hundreds&rdquo; were quite trivial in yield, and did
not involve any serious loss to the revenue. Perhaps the most
remarkable feature of the English customs of the 19th century
was the steadiness of the receipts. In spite of trade depressions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page466" id="page466"></a>466</span>
commercial crises and sweeping changes in rates, the annual
revenue in the period 1815-1900 only varied between £19,000,000
and £24,000,000; though, on balance, duties amounting to
£30,000,000 were remitted. The potential resources of this
branch of revenue were made evident in the rapid rise of the yield
by the new taxation imposed for the South African War (1899-1902).
In consequence of this increase the customs became
equal to the excise in return, and, combined, they collected over
£60,000,000 annually from the consumption of commodities.
They accordingly afforded a counterpoise to the burden put on
income and property, or, more accurately speaking, they obtained
due, or somewhat more than due, contribution from the
smaller incomes, particularly those of the working class.</p>

<p>The exemption of raw materials and food; the absence of
duties on imported, as on home manufactures; the selection of
a small number of articles for duty; the rather rigorous treatment
of spirits and tobacco, were the salient marks of the English
fiscal system which grew up in the 19th century. The part of
the system most criticised was the very narrow list of dutiable
articles. Why, it was asked, should a choice be made of certain
objects for the purpose of imposing heavy taxation on them?
The answer has been that they were taken as typical of consumption
in general and were easily supervised for taxation.
Moreover, the sumptuary element is introduced by the policy
of putting exceptionally heavy duties on spirits and tobacco,
with lighter charges on the less expensive wines and beers.
Facility of collection and distribution of taxation over a larger
class appear to be the grounds for the inclusion of the tea and
coffee duties, which are further supported by the need for
obtaining a contribution of, roughly speaking, over half the tax
revenue by duties on commodities. The last consideration led,
at the beginning of the 20th century, to the sugar tax and the
temporary duties on imported corn and exported coal.</p>

<p>As a support to the great divisions of income-tax, Death Duties,
Excise and Customs, the stamps, fees and miscellaneous taxes
are of decided service. A return of £9,000,000 was secured by
stamp duties.</p>

<p>In recent years the so-called &ldquo;non-tax&rdquo; revenue largely increased,
owing to the extension of the postal and telegraphic
services. The real gain is not so great, as out of gross receipts
of £22,000,000 over £17,500,000 is absorbed in expenses, while
the carriage of ordinary letters seems to be the only profitable
part of these services. Crown lands and rights (such as vintage
charges) are of even less financial value.</p>

<p>One cardinal principle of the greatest English finance ministers
has been the avoidance of deficits or undue surpluses. Gladstone&rsquo;s
inheritance of doctrine from Peel &ldquo;was to estimate
expenditure liberally, to estimate revenue carefully, to make
each year pay its own expenses, and to take care that your
charge is not greater than your income.&rdquo; This method of
treatment requires that taxation shall be productive in yield,
and that it shall be so elastic as to admit of expansion, a function
specially assigned to the income-tax. It may also be said to
involve due care in the treatment of the national resources.
The reaction of ill-chosen taxes on industry is a hindrance to
their productiveness and their growth.</p>
